# Contributing to OrchestraOS

Welcome to the OrchestraOS project! We appreciate your interest in contributing.

This document outlines the guidelines and best practices for contributing to the OrchestraOS codebase, with a particular focus on documentation. Given the complexity and rapid evolution of this project, clear and consistent documentation is paramount.

## Documentation Principles

Our documentation strategy is designed to support developers working on the core compiler, especially during the scaffolding and iterative development phases. It aims to capture critical insights, common pitfalls, and design rationale that might not be immediately obvious from the code alone.

1.  **Developer-Centric:** Documentation is primarily for fellow and future developers. It should be technical, precise, and focused on enabling efficient understanding and modification of the codebase.
2.  **Contextual & Discoverable:** Documentation should live as close as possible to the code it describes. Information should be easy to find when navigating the project structure.
3.  **Actionable & Concise:** Guidelines should be clear, brief, and provide concrete examples where applicable. Avoid unnecessary prose.
4.  **Living Document:** Documentation is not a one-time effort. It must evolve with the codebase. If code changes, relevant documentation must be updated. If a new insight or workaround is discovered, it should be documented.
5.  **Focus on "Why":** While code explains "what" is being done, documentation should explain "why" it's being done, especially for non-obvious design choices, workarounds, or complex interactions.
