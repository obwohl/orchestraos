# Scripts

This directory contains utility scripts for the Orchestra project.

## `run-clang-format.py`

This script automatically formats all C++ source and header files within the `orchestra-compiler` directory according to the style defined in the project's `.clang-format` file.

### Usage

To run the script, execute it from the root of the repository:

```bash
./scripts/run-clang-format.py
```

It is recommended to run this script before committing any changes to C++ files to ensure a consistent code style across the project.
