# Orchestra Compiler Library Directory

This directory contains the C++ implementation files for the Orchestra compiler.

## Structure

The source files are organized into subdirectories based on their component. The most important subdirectories are:

*   **`Orchestra/`**: Contains the core implementation for the Orchestra dialect, its operations, and its interfaces.
*   **`Orchestra/Transforms/`**: Contains the implementation of the custom transformation passes.

Files in this directory tree provide the concrete logic for the components whose public APIs are defined in the `include/` directory.
