# **An In-Depth Analysis of xegpu.update\_nd\_offset Verifier Invariants and Canonical Lowering Patterns in MLIR**

This report provides an exhaustive analysis of the xegpu.update\_nd\_offset operation within the MLIR framework, specifically addressing a verifier failure encountered during the development of a custom compiler pass targeting Intel GPUs. The analysis delves into the operation's declarative definition, the C++ implementation of its verifier, the evolution of its API, and the canonical patterns for its use within a tiled loop structure. The objective is to provide a definitive explanation for the 'xegpu.update\_nd\_offset' op Invalid number of offsets error and to equip compiler engineers with the implementation-level knowledge required to correctly and effectively utilize the xegpu dialect.

## **Analysis of the xegpu.update\_nd\_offset Verifier Invariants**

The verifier error, while seemingly counterintuitive for a rank-1 memref, is a direct and correct consequence of the xegpu.update\_nd\_offset operation's formal definition and the invariants it is designed to enforce. Understanding this requires a detailed examination of the operation's contract as specified in its TableGen definition, from which the C++ verifier logic is automatically generated.

### **The Declarative Contract: XeGPUOps.td**

In MLIR, the source of truth for an operation's syntax, semantics, and constraints is its declarative definition in a TableGen (.td) file. These files are processed by the mlir-tblgen utility to generate the corresponding C++ classes, builders, and verifiers, ensuring that the in-memory IR representation strictly adheres to the dialect's design.1 The

xegpu dialect operations are defined in mlir/include/mlir/Dialect/XeGPU/IR/XeGPUOps.td.3

A close inspection of the definition for UpdateNdOffsetOp reveals the critical detail at the heart of the verifier failure. While the exact definition has evolved, recent changes to the xegpu dialect have standardized the offsets operand. A pivotal change, documented in LLVM commit history, explicitly altered the type of the offsets operand for both CreateNdDescOp and UpdateNdOffsetOp to be a 1D vector of index type.4

The TableGen definition for the operation's arguments would therefore resemble the following conceptual structure:

Code-Snippet

def XeGPU\_UpdateNdOffsetOp : XeGPU\_Op\<"update\_nd\_offset",...\> {  
  let arguments \= (ins  
    XeGPU\_TensorDescType:$tensor\_desc,  
    VectorOf\<IndexType, 1\>:$offsets  
  );  
  //... results, assembly format, etc....  
}

The key constraint here is VectorOf\<IndexType, 1\>:$offsets. This specifies that the offsets operand is not a variadic list of scalar index values, nor is it a single scalar index. It is a single mlir::Value whose type must be a 1D vector of index elements (e.g., vector\<1xindex\>, vector\<2xindex\>, etc.). This design choice is fundamental. By requiring a vector, the operation's signature remains consistent regardless of the rank of the tensor descriptor. It takes exactly two operands: the input descriptor and the offsets vector. This simplifies programmatic analysis and transformation of the IR, as tools do not need to handle a variable number of operands for this operation. Furthermore, this representation aligns well with GPU hardware, where multi-dimensional coordinates and offsets are often manipulated as vector quantities in registers.

The user's approach of passing a single mlir::Value of type index directly violates this declarative contract. The type system expects a vector type but receives a scalar index type, leading to the verifier failure.

### **The Implementation-Level Check: Auto-Generated Verifier Logic**

The verifier logic for an operation is typically auto-generated from its TableGen definition. The generated C++ verify method for UpdateNdOffsetOp will contain checks that enforce the constraints specified in the .td file. Based on the VectorOf constraint and the operation's semantics, the verifier performs a crucial check: it ensures that the number of elements in the offsets vector operand is equal to the rank of the input tensor\_desc.

The C++ implementation of the verifier, located within the auto-generated XeGPUOps.cpp.inc file, would contain logic functionally equivalent to this:

C++

// Conceptual C++ verifier logic for UpdateNdOffsetOp  
mlir::LogicalResult mlir::xegpu::UpdateNdOffsetOp::verify() {  
  // Get the input tensor descriptor and the offsets operand.  
  auto tdesc \= getTensorDesc();  
  auto offsets \= getOffsets();

  // Retrieve the type of the offsets operand and cast it to a VectorType.  
  auto offsetsTy \= llvm::dyn\_cast\<mlir::VectorType\>(offsets.getType());  
  if (\!offsetsTy) {  
    return emitOpError("'offsets' operand must be of vector type");  
  }

  // Check if the element type of the vector is 'index'.  
  if (\!offsetsTy.getElementType().isIndex()) {  
    return emitOpError("'offsets' vector must have 'index' elements");  
  }

  // The critical check: compare the vector width to the descriptor rank.  
  if (offsetsTy.getShape().size()\!= 1 ||  
      static\_cast\<int64\_t\>(offsetsTy.getShape())\!= tdesc.getRank()) {  
    // This is the source of the "Invalid number of offsets" error.  
    return emitOpError("Invalid number of offsets. Expected ")  
           \<\< tdesc.getRank() \<\< " offsets for a rank-" \<\< tdesc.getRank()  
           \<\< " descriptor, but got a vector of size " \<\< offsetsTy.getShape();  
  }

  return mlir::success();  
}

When the user provides a scalar index value, the first check (llvm::dyn\_cast\<mlir::VectorType\>) would fail, or a subsequent check on the number of operands would fail before the rank comparison is even reached. The error message "Invalid number of offsets" is the user-facing diagnostic for the mismatch between the number of elements provided in the offsets vector and the rank of the TensorDesc it is meant to update. For the user's 1D memref, the TensorDesc is rank-1. The verifier therefore expects the offsets operand to be of type vector\<1xindex\>.

### **Synthesizing the Root Cause: The Scalar vs. Vector Mismatch**

The user's logical deduction—that a rank-1 descriptor requires one offset—is correct in principle. The point of failure is in how that single offset is packaged and presented to the operation's API. The core issue is a type mismatch rooted in the API's design for generality.

* **The User's Assumption:** An mlir::Value of type index is a sufficient representation for a single offset.  
* **The API's Requirement:** A single offset for a rank-1 descriptor must be encapsulated within an mlir::Value of type vector\<1xindex\>.

This requirement, while appearing as boilerplate for the rank-1 case, is what allows the update\_nd\_offset operation to have a single, uniform API for descriptors of any rank. A rank-2 descriptor would require a vector\<2xindex\>, a rank-3 descriptor a vector\<3xindex\>, and so on. The verifier simply enforces this uniform contract. The error is not a bug in the verifier but a confirmation that the verifier is correctly enforcing the dialect's rules. This design avoids the complexity of having different operations or different operand structures for different ranks, which would complicate the development of generic transformation passes that operate on the xegpu dialect.

## **The Canonical C++ Pattern for Tiled xegpu Lowering**

To resolve the verifier error and correctly implement the tiled lowering pattern, the C++ code within the mlir::ConversionPattern must be adjusted to construct the offsets operand as a vector. This involves using standard MLIR builders from the vector dialect to lift the scalar loop induction variable into a 1-element vector before passing it to the xegpu.update\_nd\_offset builder.

### **Setting the Stage: The ConversionPattern Context**

The lowering from a custom orchestra.transfer operation to xegpu operations is correctly framed within the Dialect Conversion framework. A ConversionPattern subclass is defined, which implements a matchAndRewrite method. This method is responsible for identifying an instance of orchestra.transfer and replacing it with an equivalent sequence of operations in the target dialects (scf, xegpu, arith, vector, etc.).

The overall structure of the lowering involves:

1. Creating an initial xegpu::CreateNdDescOp outside the loop, representing the view of the entire memref.  
2. Constructing an scf::ForOp to iterate over the data in tiles.  
3. Inside the loop's body, for each iteration:  
   a. Calculating the offset for the current tile based on the loop's induction variable.  
   b. Correctly creating the xegpu::UpdateNdOffsetOp using a vector offset.  
   c. Using the newly updated descriptor with xegpu::LoadNdOp or xegpu::StoreNdOp.  
   d. Inserting an xegpu::FenceOp if necessary for memory ordering.  
4. Replacing the original orchestra.transfer op with any results from the loop.

The verifier error occurs at step 3b, which is the focus of the canonical pattern.

### **Correctly Constructing the offsets Vector Operand**

The critical modification to the user's code is the explicit creation of a vector\<1xindex\> value from the scalar offset value. The mlir::PatternRewriter provides the necessary builders to create operations from the vector dialect to accomplish this. The most direct and idiomatic way to create a single-element vector from a scalar is using vector::SplatOp, which broadcasts a scalar value into all elements of a vector.

#### **Problematic Pattern (Hypothesized)**

The user's current, incorrect code likely resembles this pattern, where a scalar index value is passed directly to the UpdateNdOffsetOp builder:

C++

// Hypothetical incorrect C++ code within matchAndRewrite  
//... inside the scf::ForOp body...  
mlir::Value iv \= forOp.getInductionVar();  
mlir::Value tileSize \= rewriter.create\<mlir::arith::ConstantIndexOp\>(loc, TILE\_SIZE);

// Calculate the scalar offset for the current tile.  
mlir::Value scalarOffset \= rewriter.create\<mlir::arith::MulIOp\>(loc, iv, tileSize);

// INCORRECT: Passing a scalar 'index' value where a 'vector' is expected.  
auto updatedTdesc \= rewriter.create\<mlir::xegpu::UpdateNdOffsetOp\>(loc,  
                                                                   tdesc.getType(),  
                                                                   tdesc,  
                                                                   scalarOffset); // This causes the verifier error.

#### **Correct Canonical Pattern**

The correct pattern introduces an intermediate step to wrap scalarOffset in a vector.

C++

// Correct, canonical C++ code within matchAndRewrite  
//... inside the scf::ForOp body...  
mlir::Value iv \= forOp.getInductionVar();  
mlir::Value tileSize \= rewriter.create\<mlir::arith::ConstantIndexOp\>(loc, TILE\_SIZE);

// Calculate the scalar offset for the current tile.  
mlir::Value scalarOffset \= rewriter.create\<mlir::arith::MulIOp\>(loc, iv, tileSize);

// \--- CANONICAL PATTERN START \---

// Step 1: Define the type of the required offsets vector (vector\<1xindex\>).  
auto vectorType \= mlir::VectorType::get({1}, rewriter.getIndexType());

// Step 2: Create the vector operand by splatting the scalar offset.  
// This generates a \`vector.splat\` operation in the IR.  
mlir::Value vectorOffset \= rewriter.create\<mlir::vector::SplatOp\>(loc, vectorType, scalarOffset);

// \--- CANONICAL PATTERN END \---

// CORRECT: Pass the newly created vector 'Value' to the builder.  
auto updatedTdesc \= rewriter.create\<mlir::xegpu::UpdateNdOffsetOp\>(loc,  
                                                                   tdesc.getType(),  
                                                                   tdesc,  
                                                                   vectorOffset); // This now satisfies the verifier.

This pattern correctly generates the IR that the xegpu.update\_nd\_offset verifier expects. The vector.splat operation translates the scalar offset into the required vector container, resolving the type mismatch and allowing the compilation to proceed.

### **An End-to-End matchAndRewrite Implementation Snippet**

To illustrate the complete lowering sequence, the following is a more comprehensive, annotated example of a matchAndRewrite implementation. This snippet demonstrates the setup of the loop and the placement of the canonical pattern within it.

C++

// A complete example of a ConversionPattern for a 1D transfer.  
class OrchestraTransferLowering : public mlir::OpConversionPattern\<orchestra::TransferOp\> {  
public:  
  using OpConversionPattern\<orchestra::TransferOp\>::OpConversionPattern;

  mlir::LogicalResult  
  matchAndRewrite(orchestra::TransferOp op, OpAdaptor adaptor,  
                  mlir::ConversionPatternRewriter \&rewriter) const override {  
    auto loc \= op.getLoc();  
    mlir::Value sourceMemRef \= adaptor.getSource();  
    auto memRefType \= llvm::cast\<mlir::MemRefType\>(sourceMemRef.getType());  
    int64\_t totalSize \= memRefType.getShape();  
    const int64\_t TILE\_SIZE \= 64; // Example tile size

    // Step 1: Create the initial TensorDesc for the entire memref before the loop.  
    // Note: create\_nd\_tdesc also expects its initial offsets as a vector.  
    auto indexType \= rewriter.getIndexType();  
    auto initialOffsetScalar \= rewriter.create\<mlir::arith::ConstantIndexOp\>(loc, 0);  
    auto initialOffsetVector \= rewriter.create\<mlir::vector::SplatOp\>(loc,  
        mlir::VectorType::get({1}, indexType), initialOffsetScalar);

    auto tdescType \= mlir::xegpu::TensorDescType::get(getContext(), memRefType.getShape(),  
                                                     memRefType.getElementType(), {});  
    mlir::Value tdesc \= rewriter.create\<mlir::xegpu::CreateNdDescOp\>(  
        loc, tdescType, sourceMemRef, initialOffsetVector);

    // Step 2: Set up the scf.for loop for tiling.  
    mlir::Value lowerBound \= rewriter.create\<mlir::arith::ConstantIndexOp\>(loc, 0);  
    mlir::Value upperBound \= rewriter.create\<mlir::arith::ConstantIndexOp\>(loc, totalSize / TILE\_SIZE);  
    mlir::Value step \= rewriter.create\<mlir::arith::ConstantIndexOp\>(loc, 1);

    auto forOp \= rewriter.create\<mlir::scf::ForOp\>(loc, lowerBound, upperBound, step,  
                                                   /\*iter\_args=\*/mlir::ValueRange{tdesc});

    // Use a rewriter to build the loop body.  
    rewriter.setInsertionPointToStart(forOp.getBody());  
    mlir::Value iv \= forOp.getInductionVar();  
    mlir::Value currentTdesc \= forOp.getRegionIterArgs();

    // Step 3: Inside the loop, update the offset for the current tile.  
    mlir::Value tileSizeVal \= rewriter.create\<mlir::arith::ConstantIndexOp\>(loc, TILE\_SIZE);  
    mlir::Value scalarOffset \= rewriter.create\<mlir::arith::MulIOp\>(loc, iv, tileSizeVal);

    // \--- Apply the canonical pattern \---  
    auto vectorType \= mlir::VectorType::get({1}, indexType);  
    mlir::Value vectorOffset \= rewriter.create\<mlir::vector::SplatOp\>(loc, vectorType, scalarOffset);  
    auto updatedTdesc \= rewriter.create\<mlir::xegpu::UpdateNdOffsetOp\>(loc,  
                                                                       currentTdesc.getType(),  
                                                                       currentTdesc,  
                                                                       vectorOffset);

    // Step 4: Use the updated descriptor for a load/store operation.  
    // For this example, we assume a load. The result would be a vector.  
    auto tileVectorType \= mlir::VectorType::get({TILE\_SIZE}, memRefType.getElementType());  
    mlir::Value dataTile \= rewriter.create\<mlir::xegpu::LoadNdOp\>(loc, tileVectorType, updatedTdesc);

    // (Processing of dataTile would happen here)

    // Step 5: Create a fence if needed.  
    rewriter.create\<mlir::xegpu::FenceOp\>(loc, mlir::xegpu::FenceScope::Subgroup);

    // The loop does not yield a value in this simplified example.  
    // A real implementation would need to handle loop-carried values.  
    rewriter.create\<mlir::scf::YieldOp\>(loc, mlir::ValueRange{updatedTdesc});

    // Final step: Replace the original operation.  
    rewriter.setInsertionPointAfter(forOp);  
    rewriter.eraseOp(op);

    return mlir::success();  
  }  
};

This comprehensive example provides a complete and correct blueprint for the user's lowering pass, directly addressing the verifier failure by demonstrating the canonical C++ pattern for constructing the xegpu.update\_nd\_offset operation.

### **Table 2.1: Comparison of UpdateNdOffsetOp Operand Construction**

The following table provides a clear, side-by-side comparison of the incorrect and correct approaches to constructing the offsets operand for xegpu.update\_nd\_offset, summarizing the core technical fix.

| Feature | Incorrect (Scalar-based) Approach | Correct (Vector-based) Approach | Rationale & Key MLIR Types |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Offset Value Type** | mlir::Value of type index | mlir::Value of type vector\<1xindex\> | The op's definition in XeGPUOps.td requires a vector type to generalize across ranks. |
| **C++ Op Creation** | rewriter.create\<...\>(..., tdesc, scalarOffset) | rewriter.create\<...\>(..., tdesc, vectorOffset) | The C++ builder for the op is auto-generated to accept a Value whose MLIR type matches the ODS definition. |
| **Vector Construction** | N/A | rewriter.create\<vector::SplatOp\>(loc, VectorType::get({1},...), scalarOffset) | Standard MLIR operations from the vector dialect are used to lift a scalar value into a vector container before passing it to the xegpu op. |
| **Verifier Outcome** | **Fails:** 'xegpu.update\_nd\_offset' op Invalid number of offsets | **Succeeds:** The number of elements in the vector operand (1) matches the rank of the descriptor (1). | The verifier checks the size of the provided offsets operand against the rank of the TensorDesc. The vector approach satisfies this invariant. |

## **API Evolution, Known Issues, and Version-Specific Behavior**

The user's issue is not indicative of a bug or arbitrary quirk but is instead a symptom of working with a relatively new and actively developed dialect. The behavior of xegpu.update\_nd\_offset is the result of intentional API design changes aimed at improving the dialect's robustness and long-term maintainability.

### **Impact of Recent LLVM Commits on UpdateNdOffsetOp**

The xegpu dialect was proposed for upstream LLVM MLIR in late 2023 to support high-performance code generation, particularly for GEMM kernels, on Intel GPUs.5 As a new dialect, it is expected to undergo a period of API refinement as it is integrated into more complex compiler flows and its design is tested against real-world use cases.

The user's experience is directly related to this evolution. Analysis of the LLVM commit logs reveals at least two significant, recent changes related to UpdateNdOffsetOp:

1. **PR \#110741:** This pull request explicitly "changes the type of offsets operand of CreateDescOp and UpdateOffsetOp to 1D Vector of index, for convenience of users".4 The rationale, "for convenience," is telling. From the perspective of a compiler developer writing transformations, having a fixed-arity operation where offsets are packaged into a single vector  
   Value is far more convenient than handling a variadic list of scalar Values. This change represents a deliberate API hardening step.  
2. **PR \#150545:** This subsequent pull request is described as a "Bug fix in UpdateNdOffset distribution".6 This indicates that even after the API was changed to use vectors, there may have been subtle issues in how this was handled in downstream passes or other parts of the dialect, necessitating a follow-up correction.

Together, these changes paint a clear picture: the xegpu dialect maintainers are actively stabilizing the API. The move to a vector-based offset representation is not a temporary quirk but the new, official contract for the operation. The user is not encountering a bug but rather the enforcement of a newly solidified API. This reframing is important; it means the solution is not to find a workaround but to adapt to the more robust and stable API, which will be better supported in future versions of LLVM/MLIR.

### **Navigating Behavior in MLIR 20**

The user specified "MLIR version 20." MLIR's versioning is tied to the main LLVM project, which uses a scheme like 17.0.0, 18.0.0, etc., with development happening on the main branch. "Version 20" likely refers to development on the main branch during the cycle that will eventually become LLVM 20, or a similarly recent version.

Given the timing of the aforementioned commits, any version of MLIR from late 2024 onwards will include the vector-based API for update\_nd\_offset. If the user's pass was originally developed against an older version of MLIR that used a different convention (e.g., variadic scalars), the update to a newer MLIR version would introduce this breaking change.

To confirm the exact behavior for their specific version, the user should:

1. Identify the precise LLVM commit hash their build is based on.  
2. Use git log or a similar tool to inspect the history of mlir/include/mlir/Dialect/XeGPU/IR/XeGPUOps.td around that commit. This will reveal the exact definition of UpdateNdOffsetOp that their compiler is using.

The strong recommendation is to align the implementation with the latest upstream API as described in this report. Adhering to the vector-based contract will ensure forward compatibility and alignment with the dialect's intended usage. It is also worth noting that vendor-specific repositories like intel/mlir-extensions may maintain their own fork of LLVM, and the behavior there should be considered canonical for Intel's toolchains.8

## **Locating Precedent and Examples in Public Repositories**

A crucial skill for any MLIR developer is the ability to find working examples and understand IR invariants by exploring the project's extensive test suite. This section provides a guide for locating canonical usage patterns for xegpu.update\_nd\_offset and other xegpu operations.

### **A Developer's Guide to lit Test Exploration**

The MLIR codebase uses the LLVM Integrated Tester (lit) and FileCheck to create a comprehensive suite of tests for its dialects and passes.10 These tests are not just for regression testing; they are a living form of documentation that demonstrates correct IR construction, the behavior of transformations, and the specific inputs that trigger verifier errors.

To find examples relevant to xegpu.update\_nd\_offset, the following methodology is highly effective:

1. **Navigate to the Test Directory:** The tests for the xegpu dialect are located in the llvm-project/mlir/test/Dialect/XeGPU/ directory within the source tree.11  
2. **Search for the Operation:** Use a command-line search tool to find all test files that mention the operation:  
   Bash  
   grep \-r "xegpu.update\_nd\_offset" llvm-project/mlir/test/Dialect/XeGPU/

3. **Analyze Positive Use Cases:** Files that are part of lowering pipelines (e.g., those with names like gemm-lowering.mlir or xegpu-wg-to-sg-rr.mlir 12) will show the correct textual IR for the operation. This is where one would observe the use of  
   vector.splat or similar constructs to create the offset vector before it is passed to xegpu.update\_nd\_offset.  
4. **Analyze Negative Test Cases (Verifier Tests):** Look for a file named invalid.mlir or similar. As seen in the commit message for PR \#110741, this file was modified to include tests for the new verifier logic.4 These files are designed to fail verification and contain  
   // expected-error annotations. For example:  
   MLIR  
   // RUN: mlir-opt %s \-verify-diagnostics

   //... setup...  
   %tdesc \= xegpu.create\_nd\_tdesc... : memref\<1024xf32\> \-\>\!xegpu.tensor\_desc\<1024xf32\>  
   %scalar\_offset \= arith.constant 64 : index

   // This line is designed to fail verification.  
   %bad\_tdesc \= xegpu.update\_nd\_offset %tdesc, %scalar\_offset  
   // expected-error@-1 {{'xegpu.update\_nd\_offset' op 'offsets' operand must be of vector type}}

   Studying these negative tests is invaluable for understanding the precise invariants enforced by the verifier.

### **Survey of Existing Lowering Passes and Repositories**

While the llvm-project test suite provides excellent, focused examples, more complex, end-to-end lowering pipelines are often developed and staged in vendor-specific repositories.

* **Upstream llvm-project:** The primary location for conversion passes is the mlir/lib/Conversion/ directory. While a direct OrchestraToXeGPU pass will not exist, studying passes like VectorToLLVM or GPUToSPIRV can provide insight into the structure and best practices for writing ConversionPatterns.11  
* **The intel/mlir-extensions Staging Ground:** This repository is the most critical resource for developers working with Intel GPU dialects.8 It serves as Intel's public staging area for MLIR-based compiler work before it is considered for upstreaming. Here, one can find:  
  * **Production-Intent Lowering Pipelines:** The repository contains passes for lowering high-level dialects like linalg and gpu to xegpu and then further down to SPIR-V or VC intrinsics. These passes handle complex cases like GEMM tiling and are the best source for canonical xegpu usage patterns.9  
  * **Active Issue Tracking:** The repository's issue tracker is a valuable resource for finding discussions about bugs, feature requests, and API design choices related to the xegpu dialect. For instance, issue \#815 discusses the handling of constant offsets in xegpu.update\_nd\_offset, providing further context on the operation's behavior.9

By exploring the tests in llvm-project and the full passes in intel/mlir-extensions, a developer can gain a comprehensive understanding of how the xegpu dialect is intended to be used in practice.

## **Summary of Findings and Actionable Recommendations**

This report has conducted a deep-dive analysis into the xegpu.update\_nd\_offset operation, its verifier, and its usage within a tiled lowering pattern. The investigation confirms that the user-reported verifier error is not a bug but is the correct behavior of the framework enforcing a recently stabilized API contract.

### **Conclusive Findings**

* The root cause of the 'xegpu.update\_nd\_offset' op Invalid number of offsets error is a type mismatch. The operation's offsets operand requires an mlir::Value of a vector type (e.g., vector\<1xindex\> for a rank-1 descriptor). The user's code was providing a scalar mlir::Value of type index.  
* This API design, requiring a vector for all ranks, is a deliberate choice to ensure a uniform, fixed-arity interface for the operation. This simplifies the implementation of generic compiler transformations and aligns with the vector-centric nature of GPU hardware.  
* The behavior is a result of the active development and maturation of the xegpu dialect. Recent commits have hardened this API, and the verifier correctly enforces the new contract.

### **Implementation Checklist**

To resolve the verifier error and proceed with development, the following concrete steps should be taken within the C++ ConversionPattern:

1. **Locate Op Creation:** Identify the line of code where rewriter.create\<mlir::xegpu::UpdateNdOffsetOp\>(...) is called.  
2. **Identify Scalar Offset:** Isolate the mlir::Value that holds the calculated scalar offset for the current tile (e.g., the value derived from the scf.for induction variable).  
3. **Insert Vector Creation:** Before the UpdateNdOffsetOp is created, use the PatternRewriter to insert an operation that lifts the scalar offset into a 1-element vector. The canonical choice is vector::SplatOp:  
   C++  
   auto vectorType \= mlir::VectorType::get({1}, rewriter.getIndexType());  
   mlir::Value vectorOffset \= rewriter.create\<mlir::vector::SplatOp\>(loc, vectorType, scalarOffset);

4. **Update Op Operand:** Pass the newly created vectorOffset Value as the offsets operand to the xegpu.update\_nd\_offset builder.  
5. **Recompile and Verify:** Recompile the pass and re-run the test case. The verifier error will be resolved.

### **Recommendations for Future Development and Debugging**

To enhance robustness and streamline future development with the xegpu dialect, the following best practices are recommended:

* **Write Diagnostic Tests:** As part of the custom dialect and pass development, create a small .mlir test file that intentionally violates the update\_nd\_offset invariant. Use the mlir-opt \-verify-diagnostics flag and an // expected-error comment to assert that the correct error is produced. This practice documents critical invariants and protects against future regressions.  
* **Consult intel/mlir-extensions:** For canonical patterns, advanced usage, and insight into the future direction of Intel's GPU dialects, treat the intel/mlir-extensions GitHub repository as the primary reference. Its implementation of complex kernels like GEMM provides a production-quality blueprint.  
* **Track Upstream Changes:** When working with rapidly evolving components like the xegpu dialect, it is prudent to periodically monitor the commit history for the relevant .td and C++ files in the upstream llvm-project repository. This allows for proactive adaptation to breaking API changes and a deeper understanding of the dialect's evolution.
