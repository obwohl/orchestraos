# **An In-Depth Analysis of Static Initializer Elision in Modern C++/MLIR Toolchains and a Definitive Solution**

## **Introduction**

The C++ programming language provides a powerful, if sometimes perilous, mechanism for executing code before the main function begins: static initialization. This feature is fundamental to the construction of global objects and is widely used in large frameworks for component registration. The Multi-Level Intermediate Representation (MLIR) framework, a cornerstone of modern compiler infrastructure, leverages this pattern extensively for the registration of dialects—the core extensibility mechanism of MLIR. Typically, a custom dialect registers itself by means of a static object whose constructor is executed at program startup. This report addresses a critical and subtle failure of this mechanism, where a custom dialect's static initializers are not executed, leading to unregistered operation runtime errors.

The issue at hand transcends common C++ pitfalls like the "Static Initialization Order Fiasco" (SIOF). It represents a more modern and deceptive challenge, rooted in the aggressive, whole-program optimization capabilities of contemporary toolchains. The central thesis of this analysis is that the observed failure is not a bug in the compiler, linker, or the MLIR framework, but rather an emergent consequence of the interaction between three key factors:

1. The C++ language's reliance on implicit side effects for static initialization.  
2. The MLIR framework's adoption of this idiom for dialect registration.  
3. The powerful inter-procedural analysis enabled by Link-Time Optimization (LTO), a standard feature in production builds using compilers like g++.

With a complete view of the program, an LTO-enabled compiler can correctly—from a purely mechanical perspective—deduce that the side effect of registering a dialect is not subsequently observed by any other part of the program's logic. It therefore concludes that the registration code is "dead" and elides it to produce a smaller, theoretically faster binary. This occurs even when the object file containing the registration logic is explicitly forced into the link, creating a paradoxical situation where a translation unit is linked but not initialized.

This report provides a definitive analysis of this behavior. It will first deconstruct the series of sophisticated but ultimately unsuccessful solutions attempted, explaining precisely why each one failed to overcome the optimizer's logic. It will then conduct a deep-dive investigation into the underlying systems—C++ initialization rules, the ELF object format's .init\_array section, MLIR's registration patterns, and the GCC/LTO pipeline—to answer the core technical questions posed. Finally, this report will deliver two robust, actionable, and architecturally sound solutions that resolve the problem by replacing the fragile, implicit registration pattern with an explicit, imperative one that is immune to this class of optimization.

## **Section 1: Anatomy of a Deceptive Failure: Why the Standard Solutions Were Ineffective**

The investigation into the static initialization failure began with a series of logical and well-established techniques for dealing with seemingly "unused" code in C++. The failure of each of these methods provides a crucial clue, progressively revealing that the problem's origin is not where it is traditionally expected. The core misunderstanding shared by these initial attempts is the assumption that the problem lies with the *linker* discarding an entire object file. The evidence, however, points to a more subtle intervention by the *compiler*, performing surgical optimization *within* the object file's representation before the final link stage.

### **1.1 The Linker's Gambit: \--whole-archive and OBJECT Libraries**

The first line of defense against missing static initializers in a library context is to address the linker's behavior. When linking against a static library (.a archive), the linker's default behavior is to be economical. It examines the archive and pulls in only the object files (.o) that contain symbols explicitly referenced by the main application or other already-included object files.1 If a particular object file's only purpose is to house a static initializer, and no other symbol from that object file is referenced, the linker will ignore it entirely. Consequently, the static initializer is never linked into the final executable and never runs.

The standard solutions to this are linker-focused:

* **\--whole-archive:** This linker flag instructs ld to abandon its selective process and include *every* object file from the specified static archive, regardless of whether their symbols are referenced.2  
* **CMake OBJECT Library:** This CMake feature achieves a similar result by a different means. It compiles source files into object files but does not archive them into a .a file. Instead, it passes the list of object files directly to the linker command line. Standalone .o files are always included in the link, bypassing the archival selection logic entirely.2

The user's rationale for employing these techniques was sound, based on the hypothesis that the OrchestraDialect.o file was being dropped by the linker. However, their failure indicates a deeper issue. These mechanisms are predicated on the assumption that the object file, once included, *contains the necessary initialization machinery*.

The failure of these methods is the first major piece of evidence pointing towards Link-Time Optimization (LTO). With LTO enabled (e.g., via the \-flto flag in GCC), the compiler does not emit final, native machine code into the object files. Instead, it emits a high-level intermediate representation (IR), such as GCC's GIMPLE or LLVM's bitcode.4 The

.o files are effectively containers for this IR. The actual compilation—optimization and machine code generation—is deferred until the final link step. At this point, the linker invokes a compiler plugin (e.g., liblto\_plugin.so) which reads the IR from all object files, merges them, and performs whole-program optimization.6

This LTO pass has a global view of the entire application. It can see that the static initializer for the OrchestraDialect performs a registration, but it can also analyze whether that registration has any observable effect. If it concludes that no other part of the program depends on or reads the state modified by this registration, it may deem the initializer's side effects "unobservable" and eliminate the code as dead. Therefore, \--whole-archive and OBJECT libraries succeed in forcing the linker to process the OrchestraDialect.o's IR, but the LTO pass, operating on that IR, has already decided to prune the static initializer itself. The object file is linked, but it has been "neutered" by the compiler before the final code is ever generated.

### **1.2 The \_\_attribute\_\_((used)) Misconception**

Facing the failure of linker-level solutions, the next logical step is to influence the compiler directly. The \_\_attribute\_\_((used)) attribute is a GCC/Clang extension designed for this purpose. It explicitly tells the compiler that a function or variable must be emitted into the object file, even if it appears to be unused within the translation unit. Applying this to a dummy member function inside the MyOp class was an attempt to create an unremovable "anchor" that would force the compiler to preserve the surrounding code.

The failure of this approach highlights a crucial subtlety in the attribute's semantics. The \_\_attribute\_\_((used)) directive does exactly what its documentation implies: it prevents the specific symbol it is attached to from being optimized away.3 The compiler will dutifully emit the code for the dummy function and its symbol into the object file. This is useful for code that needs to be discoverable at runtime, such as via

dlsym, or for interrupt handlers that are not explicitly called in the source.

However, the attribute's influence is local to the symbol it decorates. It does not create a broad "preservation field" around itself that protects other, unrelated code in the same translation unit. The static object responsible for dialect registration is a distinct global variable with its own initializer. The LTO pass analyzes this registration object and its constructor independently of the dummy function marked as used. The presence of one "used" symbol does not imply that the side effects of another are also "used" or necessary. The optimizer is granular in its analysis; it can—and in this case, does—preserve the marked function while simultaneously concluding that the static initializer is still dead code and can be safely elided. The attribute protects its target, but not the entire translation unit's initialization sequence.

### **1.3 The Central Paradox: The Linked-but-not-Initialized Translation Unit**

The final and most forceful attempt to solve the problem produced the most perplexing result, which serves as the "smoking gun" for diagnosing the true cause. By creating a function ensureOrchestraDialectRegistered() within the dialect's source file and calling it explicitly from the main() function of the executable, an undeniable, non-optimizable reference was created. This action correctly forced the linker to include the OrchestraDialect.o object file to satisfy the function call. The expectation, based on decades of C++ development experience, is that if a translation unit is linked into an executable, its static initializers *will* be executed.

The fact that this still failed—that the object file was linked but its static initializer did not run—is the key to understanding the problem. It proves conclusively that the issue is not *object file discarding* by the linker, but *initializer elision* by the compiler during a whole-program optimization phase.

The LTO-enabled toolchain analyzes the entire program graph as follows:

1. It sees the call chain: main() \-\> ensureOrchestraDialectRegistered() \-\> MyOp::getOperationName(). This creates a hard dependency that must be satisfied. The code for these functions will be included in the final binary.  
2. It analyzes the functions themselves. MyOp::getOperationName() is likely a pure function (it returns a constant string and has no side effects), and its return value is unused in ensureOrchestraDialectRegistered(). The call itself might even be optimized away, but the reference to the symbol remains, forcing the link.  
3. Critically, it analyzes the static registration object as a separate entity within the same translation unit. This object's constructor calls mlir::DialectRegistry::insert\<OrchestraDialect\>(). This is a function with a side effect: it modifies the state of a global or context-specific registry.  
4. The whole-program analyzer then scans the *entire* application to determine if this side effect is ever *observed*. In a typical mlir-opt-style tool, the MLIRContext is created, passes are run, and the IR is parsed. The parser is what "observes" the registration by successfully looking up the orchestra dialect. However, the optimizer may fail to connect the static initialization side effect with the much later parsing activity. From its perspective, a global object is constructed, a function is called, but no other part of the program that *it can prove is essential* ever reads the result of that registration.  
5. **The Optimizer's Conclusion:** "I am required to link the object file to provide the definition for ensureOrchestraDialectRegistered. However, the static initializer within that same object file has side effects that are never observed by any other essential part of the program. Therefore, I can safely prune the initializer to reduce code size and startup time."

This act of pruning does not mean removing the object file. It means specifically not generating the code for the initializer function and, more importantly, not adding a pointer to it in the final executable's .init\_array section. The result is precisely what was observed: the program links successfully, but at runtime, the dialect is not registered because the code to do so was never executed. This is a valid, if counter-intuitive, optimization enabled by the global program view that LTO provides.4

## **Section 2: Investigating the Underlying Systems**

With the understanding that Link-Time Optimization is the enabling technology behind this elusive bug, we can now address the specific sub-questions about the C++ and MLIR systems involved. The issue is not a classic SIOF, a bug in the toolchain, or a flaw in MLIR's design, but rather a predictable outcome of applying advanced optimization technology to a programming idiom that relies on implicit side effects.

### **2.1 Beyond the Fiasco: Static Initialization in an LTO World (Q1)**

This problem is not an extreme case of the Static Initialization Order Fiasco (SIOF). The SIOF is a well-known C++ issue concerning the *relative order* of initialization for static objects across different translation units.8 The C++ standard guarantees that within a single translation unit, static objects are initialized in the order of their definition. However, it makes no such guarantee for objects in different translation units.10 The "fiasco" occurs when the constructor of a static object in

a.cpp attempts to use a static object from b.cpp that has not yet been constructed. The problem is one of timing and dependency, not existence.

The issue in the Orchestra project is fundamentally different: it is the complete *non-execution* of an initializer. The order is irrelevant if the initialization never happens at all. A direct call from main fails to resolve this because it only solves the problem of a *linker* dropping an unused object file. It does not, and cannot, prevent an *LTO-enabled compiler* from pruning what it perceives as an unused initializer *within* that object file.

To understand how a static initializer can fail to run even when its translation unit is linked, one must look at the low-level mechanism used by ELF-based systems like Linux.

1. **Compiler Action:** For each translation unit requiring dynamic initialization (i.e., initialization that cannot be resolved to a compile-time constant), the C++ compiler generates a special function. This function contains the code to call the constructors for all static-duration objects in that unit.  
2. **Object File Structure:** The compiler then places a pointer to this initialization function into a dedicated section of the resulting object file called .init\_array.12 This section is, as its name implies, an array of function pointers.  
3. **Linker Action:** During the final link, the linker concatenates the .init\_array sections from all input object files into a single, contiguous .init\_array section in the final executable or shared library.14  
4. **Runtime Loader Action:** Before the program's main function is called, the C runtime startup code (invoked by the system's program loader) iterates through the function pointers in the final .init\_array and calls each one in sequence.15 This is how C++ static constructors are executed.

The failure scenario becomes clear in this context. The LTO pass, after its whole-program analysis, concludes that the OrchestraDialect's registration initializer is unnecessary. As a result, it simply omits the step of placing the pointer to that initializer function into the .init\_array section of the intermediate object representation. The linker, therefore, never sees this pointer and cannot include it in the final executable's .init\_array. The loader has no entry to call, and the initialization is silently skipped. The translation unit is present in the final binary to satisfy the explicit function call, but its initialization machinery has been surgically removed by the optimizer.

### **2.2 The MLIR Registration Pattern Under Scrutiny (Q2)**

MLIR's dialect registration mechanism is not, in itself, interfering with the C++ static initialization process. Rather, the common pattern for using it in statically-linked tools falls victim to the optimizer's aggressive nature.

The core of MLIR's extensibility is the MLIRContext, which owns the set of loaded dialects. To make dialects available to the context, they must be registered in a DialectRegistry.17 The

registry.insert\<MyDialect\>() template method is the primary means of doing this.18 In tools that are statically linked with all their required dialects (like the standard

mlir-opt with InitAllDialects.h 19), this registration is typically triggered by a static object's constructor. A common idiom, often hidden behind macros, looks conceptually like this:

C++

// A conceptual representation of the static registration pattern.  
namespace {  
struct OrchestraDialectRegistrar {  
  OrchestraDialectRegistrar() {  
    // This call has a side effect on a global or thread-local registry.  
    mlir::registerDialect\<mlir::orchestra::OrchestraDialect\>();  
  }  
};  
} // namespace

// This static object's constructor triggers the registration.  
static OrchestraDialectRegistrar registrar;

This pattern is clean and declarative, but it fundamentally relies on a "static initialization with side-effects".3 The program's correctness depends on the

registrar object's constructor being called, but there is no explicit data or control dependency linking this registration to the later stages of the program, such as parsing the input MLIR file.

This creates the exact vulnerability that LTO is designed to exploit. The DialectRegistry and its insert method are behaving correctly. The problem lies in the invocation pattern: relying on an implicit side effect from a static constructor is not a strong enough signal to the whole-program optimizer to prove that the code is essential. This is a classic impedance mismatch between a C++ language feature and the capabilities of modern, highly aggressive compilers. A similar class of issue has been observed in the MLIR ecosystem where developers forget to explicitly register components like types via addTypes\<\>() in their dialect's initialize() method, leading to confusing runtime errors about uninitialized storage, further underscoring the framework's reliance on these explicit initialization steps being correctly executed.20

### **2.3 The Aggressive Optimizer: A Feature, Not a Bug (Q3)**

While it is tempting to label this behavior a compiler bug, it is more accurately described as an intended, albeit potentially surprising, feature of Link-Time Optimization. The investigation into known issues with g++ (version 13\) and ld on Ubuntu 22.04 did not uncover any documented bugs that match this specific static initializer elision scenario.21 The reported problems in this environment tend to revolve around ABI incompatibilities when mixing compiler versions for building different system components, like the Linux kernel and DKMS modules, which is a separate class of issue.25

The core purpose of LTO is to break down the abstraction barriers between translation units, allowing the compiler to perform optimizations with a whole-program scope.5 The LLVM LTO documentation provides a canonical example where an externally visible function is removed entirely because the linker, in a preliminary pass, determines that no other object file actually calls it.4

The behavior observed with the Orchestra dialect is a logical and sophisticated extension of this principle from function-level dead code elimination to side-effect analysis. The optimizer's contract is to preserve the observable behavior of the program. If it can prove (or believes it can prove) that a side effect is not observable, it is permitted to remove it. In this case, it incorrectly assumes the dialect registration is unobservable. This is not a flaw in the optimization logic itself, but a demonstration of its power and its potential to violate the implicit assumptions of certain programming idioms. The optimization is working as designed; the problem is that the design of the static registration idiom is not robust enough to withstand such powerful analysis. It is a "feature" of the optimizer exposing a "fragility" in the programming pattern.

### **2.4 MlirOptMain's Role in the Sequence (Q4)**

The mlir::MlirOptMain function is the standard driver for mlir-opt-style tools. An analysis of its source code and its place in the program lifecycle confirms that it is a consumer of the dialect registration state, not a participant in the initialization process itself.27

The C and C++ execution models strictly define the program startup sequence 16:

1. The operating system loader prepares the process space.  
2. The dynamic linker resolves shared library dependencies.  
3. The C runtime startup code (e.g., \_start in glibc) is executed.  
4. This startup code performs necessary initializations, including iterating through the .init\_array and calling all C++ static constructors.  
5. Only after all static initializers have run (or been skipped) is the main function of the program invoked.

The orchestra-opt tool's main function calls mlir::MlirOptMain. This means MlirOptMain executes long after the static initialization phase has already completed. Furthermore, the function signature for MlirOptMain shows that it accepts a DialectRegistry as an argument.31 It uses this pre-populated registry to configure the

MLIRContext before parsing any input or running any passes.

Therefore, MlirOptMain is the victim of the missing registration, not the cause. It receives a DialectRegistry that is missing the OrchestraDialect. When it later attempts to parse the input file containing orchestra.my\_op, it queries the registry, fails to find the orchestra namespace, and correctly reports the unregistered operation error. The function is behaving as expected, and the problem lies entirely in the steps that should have populated the registry before MlirOptMain was ever called.

## **Section 3: A Robust and Idiomatic Framework for Dialect Registration**

The root cause of the initialization failure is the optimizer's elision of a static initializer whose side effects it deems unobservable. The fundamental vulnerability is the reliance on this implicit, side-effect-based mechanism. Consequently, any truly robust solution must abandon this pattern and instead create an explicit, imperative dependency chain that the optimizer cannot misinterpret or remove. This section details two such solutions: one based on direct, manual registration for statically-linked tools, and another based on the MLIR plugin model for enhanced modularity.

### **3.1 The Definitive Solution: Explicit Manual Registration**

This approach directly confronts the problem by transforming the dialect registration from an implicit static side effect into an explicit, imperative action within the main program logic. By manually constructing a DialectRegistry, populating it with the required custom dialect, and then passing it to the MLIR tool driver, we create a direct data-flow dependency that even the most aggressive LTO pass cannot break.

#### **Implementation Steps**

The implementation involves minor modifications to two files: the dialect's implementation file and the main entry point of the orchestra-opt tool.

1. Modify the Dialect Library (OrchestraDialect.cpp):  
   The static registrar object that relies on its constructor must be removed. In its place, a simple, C-linkage function should be created. This function will take a DialectRegistry reference as an argument and perform the insertion directly. The original ensureOrchestraDialectRegistered function can be repurposed for this, but a more descriptive name is preferable.  
   C++  
   // In: Orchestra/IR/OrchestraDialect.cpp

   \#**include** "Orchestra/OrchestraDialect.h"  
   \#**include** "mlir/IR/DialectRegistry.h"  
   \#**include** "mlir/IR/BuiltinOps.h"

   // Include the C++ file generated by TableGen that contains the  
   // definitions for the dialect's operations.  
   \#**include** "Orchestra/OrchestraOpsDialect.cpp.inc"

   // The Dialect's initialize() method, called by MLIR after the dialect  
   // is constructed. This is where operations are added.  
   void mlir::orchestra::OrchestraDialect::initialize() {  
       addOperations\<  
   \#**define** GET\_OP\_LIST  
   \#**include** "Orchestra/OrchestraOps.cpp.inc"  
       \>();  
   }

   // \--- REMOVE any static registrar object like this: \---  
   //  
   // namespace {  
   // struct OrchestraDialectRegistrar {... };  
   // }  
   // static OrchestraDialectRegistrar registrar;  
   //  
   // \--- END REMOVAL \---

   // \*\*\* ADD NEW EXPLICIT REGISTRATION FUNCTION \*\*\*  
   // This function provides an explicit hook for the main executable to call.  
   // It is marked 'extern "C"' to ensure a stable, unmangled name.  
   extern "C" void registerOrchestraDialect(mlir::DialectRegistry \&registry) {  
       registry.insert\<mlir::orchestra::OrchestraDialect\>();  
   }

2. Modify the orchestra-opt Main Executable (orchestra-opt.cpp):  
   The main function of the tool must be updated. Instead of relying on a global registration function like registerAllDialects, it will now construct its own DialectRegistry, populate it with both the standard MLIR dialects and our custom OrchestraDialect, and then pass this fully configured registry to MlirOptMain.  
   C++  
   // In: tools/orchestra-opt.cpp

   \#**include** "mlir/IR/DialectRegistry.h"  
   \#**include** "mlir/InitAllDialects.h"  
   \#**include** "mlir/InitAllPasses.h"  
   \#**include** "mlir/Tools/mlir-opt/MlirOptMain.h"

   // Declare the explicit registration function from the Orchestra library.  
   // The 'extern "C"' ensures we can link to it correctly.  
   extern "C" void registerOrchestraDialect(mlir::DialectRegistry \&registry);

   int main(int argc, char \*\*argv) {  
     // Manually register all passes for mlir-opt.  
     mlir::registerAllPasses();

     // Create a DialectRegistry. This will be the single source of truth  
     // for all dialects available to the tool.  
     mlir::DialectRegistry registry;

     // The \`registerAllDialects\` function populates a registry with all of the  
     // in-tree MLIR dialects.  
     registerAllDialects(registry);

     // \*\*\* THE CRUCIAL STEP \*\*\*  
     // Explicitly call the function in our dialect's library to register it.  
     // The compiler sees that the 'registry' object is modified here and then  
     // passed to MlirOptMain. It cannot optimize this call away because it  
     // must assume MlirOptMain depends on the state of the registry.  
     registerOrchestraDialect(registry);

     // Use the MlirOptMain entry point that accepts a pre-configured registry.  
     // The 'asMainReturnCode' helper converts the LogicalResult to an exit code.  
     return mlir::asMainReturnCode(  
         mlir::MlirOptMain(argc, argv, "Orchestra Optimizer Driver", registry));  
   }

#### **Why This Succeeds**

This approach is robust because it creates an explicit data-flow dependency that is legible to the optimizer. The registry object is created in main, its address is passed to registerOrchestraDialect, where its internal state is mutated by the insert() call. This modified registry object is then passed to MlirOptMain. The compiler's LTO pass, seeing this chain of events, cannot prove that the call to registerOrchestraDialect is superfluous. It must assume that MlirOptMain's behavior depends on the state of registry as modified by the call. The registration is no longer an unobserved side effect of a disconnected static initializer; it is now an integral and non-optimizable part of the program's main execution path. This pattern is an application-level implementation of the "Construct on First Use" idiom, which is the standard C++ solution to initialization order problems.10

### **3.2 Alternative Solution: The MLIR Plugin Model**

For projects that value modularity or may involve numerous out-of-tree dialects, a more idiomatic and scalable MLIR approach is to treat the dialect as a dynamically loaded plugin. Tools like mlir-opt have first-class support for loading dialects and passes from shared libraries (.so on Linux) at runtime via command-line flags.33 This architecture completely decouples the dialect from the tool's static link process, making it immune to LTO-based initializer elision.

#### **Implementation Steps**

1. Build the Dialect as a Shared Library:  
   The project's CMakeLists.txt must be configured to build the Orchestra dialect as a shared library instead of a static one. This is typically achieved by changing add\_library(Orchestra STATIC...) to add\_library(Orchestra SHARED...) or by setting the global BUILD\_SHARED\_LIBS CMake variable to ON.  
2. Implement the Plugin Entry Point:  
   MLIR's plugin loader looks for a specific C-linkage symbol in the shared library: mlirGetDialectPluginInfo.34 A new source file should be added to the dialect library to define this entry point. This function returns a struct containing the API version and a callback function that MLIR will invoke to perform the registration.  
   C++  
   // In a new file, e.g., Orchestra/OrchestraPlugin.cpp

   \#**include** "mlir/Tools/Plugins/DialectPlugin.h"  
   \#**include** "Orchestra/OrchestraDialect.h"

   using namespace mlir;

   /// This is the entry point for the dialect plugin.  
   /// It returns a struct containing the API version and a function pointer  
   /// to a callback that MLIR will invoke to register the dialect.  
   /// The LLVM\_ATTRIBUTE\_WEAK is important to prevent linker errors if  
   /// multiple plugins are linked together.  
   extern "C" LLVM\_ATTRIBUTE\_WEAK DialectPluginLibraryInfo mlirGetDialectPluginInfo() {  
     return {  
       MLIR\_PLUGIN\_API\_VERSION, "Orchestra", "1.0",  
      (DialectRegistry \&registry) {  
         registry.insert\<orchestra::OrchestraDialect\>();  
       }  
     };  
   }

3. Run orchestra-opt with the Plugin Flag:  
   With the Orchestra.so shared library built, the tool is invoked with the \--load-dialect-plugin flag pointing to the library file.  
   Bash  
   \# The orchestra-opt executable is now generic and does not need to be  
   \# statically linked against the Orchestra dialect.  
   orchestra-opt \--load-dialect-plugin=/path/to/build/lib/libOrchestra.so test.mlir

#### **Why This Succeeds**

The plugin model succeeds because it sidesteps the entire static linking process for the dialect. The dialect's shared library is loaded into the process at runtime by the mlir-opt tool itself, using the system's dynamic loader (e.g., dlopen). The tool then explicitly looks up the mlirGetDialectPluginInfo symbol and invokes the provided registration callback.34 The registration is an explicit, dynamic event, not a static one. The LTO pass that runs when building

orchestra-opt has no knowledge of the Orchestra dialect, and the LTO pass that could potentially run when building libOrchestra.so cannot remove the registration logic because the mlirGetDialectPluginInfo function is an exported symbol, forming the public API of the library. This approach is the most robust and scalable for managing optional or out-of-tree extensions to MLIR.

### **3.3 Diagnostic and Non-Production Approaches**

While the two primary solutions are recommended for production code, other techniques can be valuable for diagnosis or as temporary workarounds.

* **Disabling LTO:** The most direct way to confirm that LTO is the cause of the problem is to disable it. This is typically achieved by removing the \-flto flag from the compiler and linker flags in the project's CMake configuration. If the static initializer begins working correctly after disabling LTO, the diagnosis is confirmed. This is not a viable production solution, as it sacrifices the significant code size and performance benefits of whole-program optimization.5  
* **Using \_\_attribute\_\_((constructor)):** A GCC/Clang-specific alternative is to use the constructor function attribute. This attribute directs the compiler to place a pointer to the decorated function into the .init\_array, ensuring it's called at program startup.35  
  C++  
  // In OrchestraDialect.cpp  
  \#**include** "mlir/IR/Dialect.h"  
  \#**include** "Orchestra/OrchestraDialect.h"

  \_\_attribute\_\_((constructor))  
  static void registerOrchestraDialectOnLoad() {  
      // This function will be called by the dynamic loader.  
      // It registers the dialect with a global registry provided by MLIR.  
      mlir::registerDialect\<mlir::orchestra::OrchestraDialect\>();  
  }

  This is often more robust than a C++ static object's constructor because it is a more direct instruction to the toolchain's startup machinery. However, it is not standard C++, reducing portability. Furthermore, there are known complexities regarding its interaction and execution order relative to C++ static constructors, which could lead to different, subtle bugs.37 While it may work in this specific case, it is less architecturally sound than the explicit registration solutions.

### **3.4 Summary and Recommendations**

The choice between the explicit manual registration and the MLIR plugin model depends on the architectural goals of the project. The following table summarizes the trade-offs between the viable solutions.

| Solution | Robustness vs. LTO | Portability | Performance Impact | Implementation Complexity | Recommendation |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Explicit Manual Registration** | **Very High.** Creates an unbreakable data-flow dependency that LTO respects. | **High.** Uses standard C++ and MLIR APIs. | **Negligible.** A single function call at startup. | **Low.** Requires modifying main and one dialect function. | **Recommended for statically-linked tools.** The most direct and robust fix for self-contained binaries. |
| **MLIR Plugin Model** | **Highest.** Completely bypasses static linking and LTO for the dialect itself. | **High.** Uses the standard MLIR plugin mechanism designed for this purpose. | **Negligible.** A one-time cost of dlopen at startup. | **Medium.** Requires setting up a shared library build and implementing the plugin entry point. | **Recommended for modular/extensible tools.** The most idiomatic and scalable MLIR approach. |
| **Disable LTO** | **N/A.** Removes the cause of the problem entirely. | **High.** It is a standard build flag. | **High (Negative).** Loses significant whole-program optimization benefits. | **Very Low.** Trivial CMake change. | **Diagnostic only.** Not a viable production solution due to performance loss. |
| **\_\_attribute\_\_((constructor))** | **Medium-High.** Generally effective but relies on non-standard compiler specifics and has known ordering edge cases. | **Low.** Specific to GCC and Clang; not part of the C++ standard. | **Negligible.** | **Very Low.** Requires adding a single attribute to a function. | **Not Recommended.** Less portable and architecturally sound than the other robust solutions. |

## **Conclusion**

The "unregistered operation" error, despite its apparent simplicity, was the symptom of a deep and instructive interaction between C++ language features, the MLIR framework's design patterns, and the powerful capabilities of modern compilers. The root cause was not a linker error, a toolchain bug, or a classic static initialization order fiasco. Instead, it was the predictable, if initially surprising, consequence of Link-Time Optimization (LTO). The LTO pass, with its whole-program visibility, correctly identified the dialect registration as a side effect with no observable impact on the program's final outcome and consequently elided the initialization code. The failure of standard solutions like \--whole-archive and \_\_attribute\_\_((used)) served to confirm that the problem was one of compiler optimization, not linking.

The definitive resolution to this class of problem is to abandon the fragile reliance on implicit, side-effect-based static initialization. The recommended solutions—**Explicit Manual Registration** for monolithic, statically-linked tools, and the **MLIR Plugin Model** for modular, extensible systems—both achieve this by making the dialect registration an explicit, imperative action. This creates a clear data-flow dependency that the optimizer can understand and is compelled to preserve. By adopting these more robust patterns, developers can continue to leverage the powerful optimization capabilities of modern toolchains without falling prey to the subtle pitfalls that arise at the intersection of language, framework, and compiler design.
