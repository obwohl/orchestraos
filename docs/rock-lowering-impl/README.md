# Final Corrected Guide to Implementing the Rock Dialect

## 1. Apology and Correction

This document provides the final, and now truly correct, instructions for implementing the `rock` dialect. 

**A personal note:** The previous versions of this guide were based on a fundamental misunderstanding on my part. I incorrectly assumed the project was using modern MLIR CMake functions (`add_mlir_tablegen`). A detailed analysis of the working `include/Orchestra/CMakeLists.txt` file has proven this assumption wrong.

**Jules, your analysis was correct from the very beginning.** The project consistently uses the legacy `mlir_tablegen` command. The long and frustrating debugging process was my fault. This guide now reflects the reality of the project's existing architecture.

All previous instructions are obsolete. This is the single source of truth.

## 2. The Core Project Pattern

An analysis of `orchestra-compiler/include/Orchestra/CMakeLists.txt` reveals the correct, working pattern for this project:

*   **CMake Command:** The project exclusively uses the legacy `mlir_tablegen()` command, not `add_mlir_tablegen()`.
*   **TableGen Generators:** It uses the corresponding legacy generators, primarily `-gen-op-defs`.
*   **Property Syntax:** The `-gen-op-defs` generator does **not** support the `let properties = [...]` syntax. However, it **does** support defining properties "in-situ" inside the `arguments` block (e.g., `IntProp<>`, `AttrProperty<>`). This is the crucial detail that allows us to meet the requirement of using properties.

## 3. Project Documents and Their Roles

To avoid any confusion, it is critical to understand the role of each document provided for this task:

*   **This `README.md` file:** This is the **primary implementation guide**. It explains the build system, the correct syntax, and the step-by-step process.
*   **`rock_2.md`:** This is the **high-level architectural guide**. It explains *what* to build—the full list of operations and all their required properties.
    *   **CRITICAL NOTE:** The example code in `rock_2.md` uses the `let properties = [...]` syntax. This syntax is **incorrect** for this environment. Ignore the literal code examples in `rock_2.md` and use the "in-situ" property syntax detailed in the plan below.
*   **`RockOps.td` (the original large file):** This is a **legacy reference file only**. Use it to look up the names and types of operations, but do not copy its syntax.

## 4. The Final, Actionable Plan

**Objective:** Create a new, isolated `OrchestraRock` library that perfectly mimics the existing, working build patterns of the `Orchestra` library.

**Step 1: Create File Structure**

Create the following files. Note the addition of `RockOps.h` and `RockOps.cpp`.

```
orchestra-compiler/
├── include/Orchestra/Dialects/Rock/
│   ├── RockDialect.h
│   ├── RockOps.h
│   └── RockOps.td
└── lib/Orchestra/Dialects/Rock/
    ├── CMakeLists.txt
    ├── RockDialect.cpp
    └── RockOps.cpp
```

**Step 2: Create TableGen Definitions (`.td` files)**

This step is unchanged and correct.

1.  **`RockDialect.td`:**
    ```tablegen
    #ifndef ORCHESTRA_DIALECT_ROCK_DIALECT_TD
    #define ORCHESTRA_DIALECT_ROCK_DIALECT_TD
    include "mlir/IR/DialectBase.td"
    def Rock_Dialect : Dialect {
      let name = "rock";
      let cppNamespace = "::mlir::rock";
      let usePropertiesForAttributes = 1;
    }
    #endif
    ```

2.  **`RockOps.td`:**
    ```tablegen
    #ifndef ORCHESTRA_DIALECT_ROCK_OPS_TD
    #define ORCHESTRA_DIALECT_ROCK_OPS_TD
    include "mlir/IR/OpBase.td"
    include "Orchestra/Dialects/Rock/RockDialect.td"

    def Rock_GemmOp : Op<Rock_Dialect, "gemm"> {
      let summary = "rock gemm operation";
      let arguments = (ins
        AttrProperty<"arch", "::mlir::StringAttr", "The target architecture.">:$properties,
        F32Tensor:$matrix_a,
        F32Tensor:$matrix_b
      );
      let results = (outs F32Tensor:$matrix_c);
    }
    #endif
    ```

**Step 3: Create C++ and Header Files**

This is the updated, critical step to avoid C++ "incomplete type" errors. The content of these files must be exact.

1.  **Create `orchestra-compiler/include/Orchestra/Dialects/Rock/RockDialect.h`:**
    ```cpp
    #ifndef ORCHESTRA_DIALECT_ROCK_DIALECT_H
    #define ORCHESTRA_DIALECT_ROCK_DIALECT_H

    #include "mlir/IR/Dialect.h"
    #include "Orchestra/Dialects/Rock/RockDialect.h.inc"

    #endif
    ```

2.  **Create `orchestra-compiler/include/Orchestra/Dialects/Rock/RockOps.h`:**
    ```cpp
    #ifndef ORCHESTRA_DIALECT_ROCK_OPS_H
    #define ORCHESTRA_DIALECT_ROCK_OPS_H

    #include "mlir/IR/OpDefinition.h"

    #define GET_OP_CLASSES
    #include "Orchestra/Dialects/Rock/RockOps.h.inc"

    #endif
    ```

3.  **Create `orchestra-compiler/lib/Orchestra/Dialects/Rock/RockOps.cpp`:** This file provides the full definitions of the op classes.
    ```cpp
    #include "Orchestra/Dialects/Rock/RockOps.h"
    #include "mlir/IR/OpImplementation.h"

    #define GET_OP_CLASSES
    #include "Orchestra/Dialects/Rock/RockOps.cpp.inc"
    ```

4.  **Create `orchestra-compiler/lib/Orchestra/Dialects/Rock/RockDialect.cpp`:** The `#include "Orchestra/Dialects/Rock/RockOps.h"` is essential.
    ```cpp
    #include "Orchestra/Dialects/Rock/RockDialect.h"
    #include "Orchestra/Dialects/Rock/RockOps.h"
    #include "mlir/IR/Builders.h"

    #include "Orchestra/Dialects/Rock/RockDialect.cpp.inc"

    void mlir::rock::RockDialect::initialize() {
      addOperations<
    #define GET_OP_LIST
    #include "Orchestra/Dialects/Rock/RockOps.cpp.inc"
      >();
    }
    ```

**Step 4: Configure the Build (`CMakeLists.txt`)**

This step remains the same. Create `orchestra-compiler/lib/Orchestra/Dialects/Rock/CMakeLists.txt` that mimics the working pattern from `include/Orchestra/CMakeLists.txt` using the `mlir_tablegen` command.

**Step 5: Integrate the New Library**

This step also remains the same.

1.  **Edit `orchestra-compiler/lib/Orchestra/CMakeLists.txt`** and add `add_subdirectory(Dialects/Rock)` at the end.
2.  **Edit `orchestra-compiler/orchestra-opt/CMakeLists.txt`** and add `OrchestraRock` to the `target_link_libraries` list.
