## **The Anatomy of MLIR Operation Registration: A First-Principles Review**

The error message "unregistered operation 'orchestra.dummy\_op' found in dialect ('orchestra') that does not allow unknown operations" signifies a fundamental breakdown in the mechanism by which an operation becomes "known" to the MLIR infrastructure. This failure occurs at runtime, specifically when the MLIR parser or a pass encounters an operation for which it has no registered description. The fact that the project compiles successfully but fails at runtime points to a subtle disconnect between the compile-time view of the code and the final linked state of the executable. To diagnose this, it is essential to first establish a precise, first-principles understanding of the entire registration lifecycle, from dialect declaration to runtime lookup.

### **The Static Registration Chain**

The registration of an operation is not a single event but a chain of them, initiated by the tool's main entry point and culminating in the population of data structures within a specific MLIRContext.

1. **DialectRegistry and the Factory Pattern**: In the orchestra-opt/main.cpp file, the line registry.insert\<orchestra::OrchestraDialect\>(); does not, as one might assume, immediately create an instance of the OrchestraDialect. Instead, it registers a *factory function* within the mlir::DialectRegistry object.1 This factory is a lightweight callable object capable of constructing an  
   OrchestraDialect on demand. This lazy approach ensures that dialects are only loaded into a context when they are actually needed.  
2. **MLIRContext and On-Demand Dialect Loading**: The mlir::MLIRContext is the central owner of all IR objects, including loaded dialects. When the context is first initialized or, more commonly, when the parser first encounters an operation with the orchestra. prefix, it consults the DialectRegistry. It finds the registered factory for the "orchestra" namespace and invokes it, finally creating a concrete instance of the orchestra::OrchestraDialect class.  
3. **The initialize() Invocation**: Immediately following the instantiation of the dialect, the MLIRContext calls the dialect's virtual initialize() method.3 This is the critical juncture where the dialect must inform the context of all the custom operations, attributes, and types it defines. The user's debugging has confirmed that this method is being called. Therefore, the failure must lie within the execution of this method or in the availability of the components it is supposed to register.

### **The Critical Role of TableGen-Generated Artifacts**

The connection between the declarative Operation Definition Specification (ODS) in .td files and the imperative C++ world is managed by mlir-tblgen, which generates several include files (.inc). A misunderstanding of the distinct roles of these files is a primary source of registration failures.

* **OrchestraOps.h.inc (The Declarations)**: This file is generated using the \-gen-op-decls flag. It contains the C++ *class declarations* for all operations defined in the TableGen source, such as class DummyOp;.5 Including this header file, for example at the top of  
  OrchestraDialect.cpp, serves one purpose: to satisfy the C++ compiler. It provides a forward declaration, making the type name orchestra::DummyOp known and allowing the code to compile without "not declared in this scope" errors. It makes a promise to the compiler that a full definition will be available later.  
* **OrchestraOps.cpp.inc (The Definitions)**: This file, generated with the \-gen-op-defs flag, contains the fulfillment of that promise. It includes the full C++ *class definitions* for each operation, implementing their member functions, verifiers, and—most critically for this analysis—the static machinery required for runtime type identification and registration. This includes the crucial MLIR\_DEFINE\_EXPLICIT\_TYPE\_ID macro expansion for each operation, which is what allows the MLIR framework to uniquely identify the C++ class associated with the string name "orchestra.dummy\_op".1

The successful compilation reported by the user, followed by a runtime failure, is the classic symptom of a declaration-definition mismatch in this context. The compiler was satisfied by the promise made by OrchestraOps.h.inc, but the runtime machinery could not find the substance of that promise because the definitions from OrchestraOps.cpp.inc were not compiled and linked into the final orchestra-opt executable.

### **The addOperations\<GET\_OP\_LIST...\>() Expansion**

The standard pattern for registering operations inside the initialize() method is a combination of a C++ template and a preprocessor macro:

C++

void OrchestraDialect::initialize() {  
  addOperations\<  
\#**define** GET\_OP\_LIST  
\#**include** "Orchestra/OrchestraOps.cpp.inc"  
  \>();  
}

This is not magic, but a clever use of C++ features.

1. The \#define GET\_OP\_LIST directive instructs the C++ preprocessor that when it includes OrchestraOps.cpp.inc, it should only expand the section guarded by if defined(GET\_OP\_LIST).  
2. Inside the generated .cpp.inc file, this section contains a comma-separated list of all the operation class names: DummyOp, MyOp, YieldOp,....4  
3. The preprocessor substitutes this list directly into the template argument for addOperations. The call effectively becomes addOperations\<DummyOp, MyOp, YieldOp,...\>().  
4. The mlir::Dialect::addOperations template function then iterates over this pack of types.7 For each operation type (e.g.,  
   DummyOp), it uses MLIR's TypeID system to get a unique runtime identifier for the C++ class. It then registers this TypeID along with the operation's string name ("orchestra.dummy\_op") and its constructors into the dialect's internal operation map.

This mechanism is what populates the lookup table that the parser uses. If this process fails, the table remains empty, and any attempt to parse an orchestra operation will result in the "unregistered operation" error.

## **Primary Diagnostic: Incomplete Integration of Generated Definitions**

The most probable cause of the described issue, given the successful compilation and the specific runtime error, is the failure to compile and link the C++ definitions of the custom operations. The user's report details the inclusion of the header (.h.inc) file, but not the definition (.cpp.inc) file, which is the "smoking gun."

### **The Missing Piece: OrchestraOps.cpp.inc**

The definitions generated by mlir-tblgen \-gen-op-defs are not automatically part of the project; they must be explicitly included into one of the C++ source files (.cpp) that comprise the dialect's library. The canonical location for this is the dialect's main implementation file, orchestra-compiler/lib/Orchestra/OrchestraDialect.cpp.

If this inclusion is omitted, the definitions for DummyOp, its methods (like getOperationName), its verifiers, and its static TypeID members are never seen by the compiler. Consequently, they are not compiled into an object file and are not included in the libOrchestra.a static library.

A key question is why this does not produce a linker error. The subtlety lies in the templated nature of addOperations. If the \#include "Orchestra/OrchestraOps.cpp.inc" within the addOperations call fails to find the file or finds an empty one (due to a build system race condition, discussed later), the GET\_OP\_LIST macro may expand to nothing. The C++ compiler then sees addOperations\<\>(), an instantiation of the template with an empty parameter pack. This is perfectly valid C++, which compiles to a function call that does nothing. The initialize() method is called, but it performs no registrations. The program links successfully because no symbols are missing—the registration code was never even referenced. The error is deferred until runtime, when the parser queries the dialect for an operation that was never registered. While some configurations can produce linker errors like undefined symbol: mlir::foo::BarOp::verifyInvariantsImpl() 1, the runtime error is the more insidious variant of the same root problem: missing operation definitions.

### **Correct Implementation Pattern**

To resolve this, the generated C++ definitions must be included in a source file. The standard and recommended pattern is to place the following code at the very end of the orchestra-compiler/lib/Orchestra/OrchestraDialect.cpp file, outside of any namespace.

C++

//... (rest of OrchestraDialect.cpp, including the initialize() method)

//===----------------------------------------------------------------------===//  
// TableGen'd op method definitions  
//===----------------------------------------------------------------------===//

\#**define** GET\_OP\_CLASSES  
\#**include** "Orchestra/OrchestraOps.cpp.inc"

The \#define GET\_OP\_CLASSES guard is critical; it ensures that the preprocessor includes the portion of the generated file containing the full C++ implementations of the operation classes.1 This single change ensures that the operation definitions are compiled into the same object file as the

OrchestraDialect itself, making them available to the linker and, ultimately, the runtime.

### **Table 2.1: Canonical Integration of TableGen Artifacts**

To prevent future ambiguity, the following table clarifies the distinct roles of the two primary generated files and their correct usage.

| Artifact | TableGen Flag | Contents | Required C++ Inclusion | Purpose | Consequence of Omission |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| OrchestraOps.h.inc | \-gen-op-decls | C++ Class *Declarations* | \#include "Orchestra/OrchestraOps.h.inc" (in .h and .cpp files needing op types) | Satisfy the **compiler** by providing forward declarations. | Compilation errors: 'DummyOp' is not a member of 'mlir::orchestra', type/symbol not declared in this scope. |
| OrchestraOps.cpp.inc | \-gen-op-defs | C++ Class *Definitions*, TypeID machinery, method implementations. | \#define GET\_OP\_CLASSES \#include "Orchestra/OrchestraOps.cpp.inc" (in **one** .cpp file) | Satisfy the **linker and runtime** by providing compiled definitions. | Linker errors (undefined symbol) or runtime errors (unregistered operation). |

## **Secondary Diagnostic: Linker-Induced Static Initializer Elision**

If the primary diagnostic—including the .cpp.inc file—does not resolve the issue, the focus of the investigation must shift from the C++ source code to the build and link stages. The problem may not be that the registration code isn't being compiled, but that the linker is discarding it as "unused."

### **The Peril of "Unused" Static Libraries**

MLIR's registration system, particularly for components defined via TableGen, relies heavily on C++ static initializers. The MLIR\_DEFINE\_EXPLICIT\_TYPE\_ID macro and related constructs create global static objects. The constructors for these objects run before the program's main function is executed, and it is within these constructors that crucial registration information is prepared.6

This creates a potential conflict with a standard optimization performed by linkers when dealing with static libraries (.a archives). By default, a linker will only pull an object file (.o) from a static archive if that object file provides a definition for a symbol that is currently undefined in the main executable or shared library being built.

The orchestra-opt tool's main.cpp file has a direct dependency on the orchestra::OrchestraDialect class via the registry.insert\<orchestra::OrchestraDialect\>() call. This guarantees that the object file containing the compiled OrchestraDialect.cpp will be pulled from libOrchestra.a by the linker. If the operation definitions from OrchestraOps.cpp.inc are included in this same source file (as per the primary diagnostic), this should be sufficient.

However, if the dialect library were structured across multiple source files (e.g., OrchestraDialect.cpp and a separate OrchestraOps.cpp), a problem could arise. If orchestra-opt only references symbols from OrchestraDialect.cpp, the linker might conclude that OrchestraOps.o is unneeded and discard it entirely. In doing so, it would also discard the static initializers responsible for the operation registration, leading to the exact runtime error observed. This behavior is known as static initializer elision and is a classic pitfall in modular C++ development.

### **The Whole-Archive Solution**

To definitively prevent the linker from discarding potentially necessary code, one must instruct it to include *every* object file from the dialect's static library, regardless of whether its symbols are directly referenced. This is achieved using "whole archive" linker flags. These flags are platform-specific.

* **GCC/Clang on Linux**: The library is wrapped with \-Wl,--whole-archive and \-Wl,--no-whole-archive.  
* **Clang on Darwin (macOS)**: The flag is \-Wl,-force\_load,\<path\_to\_lib\>.  
* **MSVC on Windows**: The flag is /WHOLEARCHIVE:\<lib\_name\>.

In the context of the orchestra project, this modification should be made in orchestra-compiler/tools/orchestra-opt/CMakeLists.txt. The target\_link\_libraries call for the orchestra-opt executable should be updated to include these flags around the dialect library target.

**CMake Implementation for orchestra-opt (Linux example):**

CMake

target\_link\_libraries(orchestra-opt PRIVATE  
    \#... other libraries like MLIRSupport, MLIRIR, etc.

    \# Force the linker to include all object files from the Orchestra  
    \# static library to ensure static initializers for op registration are run.  
    "-Wl,--whole-archive"  
    Orchestra  
    "-Wl,--no-whole-archive"  
)

This command instructs the linker to temporarily enter a "whole archive" mode, link the Orchestra library (pulling in all its constituent object files), and then return to its normal mode. This robustly solves the problem of static initializer elision.9

## **Tertiary Diagnostics: Build System and Version-Specific Factors**

If neither of the preceding diagnostics resolves the registration failure, the investigation must turn to more subtle interactions within the build system and potential version-specific behaviors of MLIR itself.

### **Flawed TableGen Build Dependencies**

Modern build systems like make and ninja heavily utilize parallelism to speed up compilation. This can introduce race conditions if the dependencies between build targets are not correctly specified in the CMakeLists.txt files.

The C++ source file OrchestraDialect.cpp depends on the generated files OrchestraOps.h.inc and OrchestraOps.cpp.inc. The build system must be explicitly told that it cannot start compiling OrchestraDialect.cpp until *after* mlir-tblgen has finished generating these .inc files. In MLIR's CMake system, this is typically handled by ensuring the add\_library(Orchestra...) command lists the TableGen output targets as dependencies.

A failure to specify this dependency can lead to an insidious intermittent bug. In a parallel build (make \-jN), the compiler might attempt to build OrchestraDialect.cpp before the .inc files exist or are complete. The \#include directive would then pull in an empty or nonexistent file. As described previously, this can compile and link without error, but the resulting library will be defective, lacking the operation registrations. This exact type of bug, a missing CMake dependency causing non-deterministic failures in parallel builds, was reported for an MLIR 18.1 source release.10

**Verification**:

1. Delete the build artifacts for the dialect: rm \-rf build/lib/Orchestra/ and rm \-rf build/include/Orchestra/.  
2. Attempt a parallel rebuild from the project's build directory: cmake \--build. \-j$(nproc).  
3. If this build fails intermittently or produces a non-working orchestra-opt, it is highly probable that a build dependency is missing in the dialect's CMakeLists.txt. The target that generates the .inc files must be added as a dependency to the add\_library(Orchestra...) target.

### **Side-Effects of MLIR 18.1 and the usePropertiesForAttributes Default**

MLIR version 18.1 introduced a significant change to the Operation Definition Specification (ODS) framework: the usePropertiesForAttributes dialect option now defaults to true.11 This feature changes the underlying storage mechanism for an operation's inherent attributes (those defined in the ODS

let arguments block) from a DictionaryAttr to a more efficient, type-safe Properties struct.

While this change is intended to be largely transparent and beneficial, it represents a new and complex code path in the TableGen backend and the C++ operation implementation. It is plausible that a specific combination of features in the Orchestra\_DummyOp definition could be interacting with this new system in an unforeseen way, triggering a bug in the property-based storage code that manifests as a registration failure.

Diagnostic Step:  
To rule out this new feature as the cause of the problem, it can be temporarily disabled for the OrchestraDialect. This is a powerful isolation technique. Modify the dialect definition in orchestra-compiler/include/Orchestra/OrchestraOps.td as follows:

Code-Snippet

def OrchestraDialect : Dialect {  
  let name \= "orchestra";  
  let cppNamespace \= "::orchestra";

  // Temporarily revert to the pre-MLIR-18 attribute storage mechanism.  
  let usePropertiesForAttributes \= 0;  
}

After making this change, perform a full clean rebuild of the project.

* If the registration issue is resolved, this strongly indicates an incompatibility or bug related to the new Properties system with the specific operation definitions in use.  
* If the issue persists, the Properties system has been successfully eliminated as a variable, and the cause almost certainly lies with the C++ integration or linker configuration as detailed in the primary and secondary diagnostics.

## **A Systematic Resolution Protocol and Verification**

To resolve the operation registration failure, proceed through the following steps in order. Each step addresses a potential point of failure, moving from the most probable cause to the least. After each step, perform a clean rebuild and test orchestra-opt.

### **The Protocol**

1. **Step 1: Verify .cpp.inc Integration (Primary Diagnostic)**  
   * **Action**: Ensure the generated C++ definitions are compiled. Add the following lines to the very end of orchestra-compiler/lib/Orchestra/OrchestraDialect.cpp:  
     C++  
     \#**define** GET\_OP\_CLASSES  
     \#**include** "Orchestra/OrchestraOps.cpp.inc"

   * **Rationale**: This is the most common cause of this error. It ensures the C++ classes for your operations are fully defined and compiled into the dialect library.  
2. **Step 2: Force Whole-Archive Linking (Secondary Diagnostic)**  
   * **Action**: Modify orchestra-compiler/tools/orchestra-opt/CMakeLists.txt to force the linker to include the entire dialect library, preventing it from discarding the static initializers needed for registration.  
     CMake  
     target\_link\_libraries(orchestra-opt PRIVATE  
         \#... other libraries  
         "-Wl,--whole-archive" Orchestra "-Wl,--no-whole-archive"  
     )

   * **Rationale**: This prevents the linker from performing dead-code elimination on the static registration logic, which it might otherwise see as "unused."  
3. **Step 3: Audit Build Dependencies (Tertiary Diagnostic)**  
   * **Action**: Inspect the CMakeLists.txt file for the Orchestra library. Ensure that the add\_library(Orchestra...) command explicitly depends on the mlir\_tablegen targets that generate the .inc files.  
   * **Rationale**: This prevents race conditions in parallel builds where C++ files could be compiled before their TableGen-generated headers are created.  
4. **Step 4: Isolate the usePropertiesForAttributes Variable (Tertiary Diagnostic)**  
   * **Action**: Temporarily disable the new default Properties system in MLIR 18.1. In orchestra-compiler/include/Orchestra/OrchestraOps.td, add let usePropertiesForAttributes \= 0; to the OrchestraDialect definition.  
   * **Rationale**: This isolates a major new feature in MLIR 18.1 as a potential variable, ruling out any unknown bugs or incompatibilities with this new system.

### **Verification Techniques**

After applying a potential fix, use the following tools to verify that the operation symbols are now correctly part of the final executable. Run these commands from the build/bin directory.

* **Using nm to Inspect Symbols**: The nm utility lists the symbols from an object file or executable. A successful registration requires the operation's TypeID resolver to be linked.  
  Bash  
  nm orchestra-opt | grep 'mlir::detail::TypeIDResolver\<mlir::orchestra::DummyOp'

  If this command produces output (showing symbols related to the DummyOp TypeID), the operation's definition has been successfully linked. An empty output indicates a continued failure at the C++ or linker level.  
* **Using a Debugger**: A debugger provides definitive proof.  
  1. Run lldb orchestra-opt or gdb orchestra-opt.  
  2. Set a breakpoint at the registration site: (lldb) b OrchestraDialect::initialize.  
  3. Run the tool with a test file: (lldb) run test.mlir.  
  4. When the breakpoint hits, step through the addOperations\<...\>() call and inspect the dialect's internal state to confirm the orchestra.dummy\_op is being added to its list of known operations.
