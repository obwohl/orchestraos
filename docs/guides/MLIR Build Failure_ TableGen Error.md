## **Deconstruction of the Build Failure: Symptom and Root Cause Analysis**

### **Validating the Initial Hypothesis**

The investigation begins by confirming the initial diagnosis of the build failure. The reported C++ compiler error, error: parse error in template argument list, occurring during the compilation of OrchestraDialect.cpp within the addOperations\<...\>() template function, is a classic downstream symptom of an upstream problem. This type of error typically arises when a C++ template is instantiated with a type that does not conform to the template's expected interface. In the context of MLIR dialect development, the types passed to addOperations are the C++ classes representing the dialect's operations, such as Orchestra::CommitOp. These classes are not written by hand; they are automatically generated by the mlir-tblgen utility from TableGen definition files (.td).1

Therefore, the chain of causality is clear and the initial hypothesis is correct:

1. An error exists in the OrchestraOps.td file.  
2. This error causes mlir-tblgen to generate a syntactically or structurally malformed C++ class definition for one of the operations in the OrchestraOps.h.inc header file.  
3. The C++ compiler, when attempting to use this malformed class in the addOperations template in OrchestraDialect.cpp, encounters a template substitution failure, which it reports as a parse error.

The problem is not a bug in the handwritten C++ code of the dialect's constructor but a flaw in the auto-generated code, originating from its TableGen source.

### **The Silent Failure of mlir-tblgen**

A central challenge in debugging this category of issue is the "silent failure" mode of mlir-tblgen. The TableGen language is processed by a frontend that parses the .td files and builds a representation of the defined records. The mlir-tblgen tool then uses various backends to translate these records into C++ code.3 The issue at hand demonstrates a gap in the toolchain's diagnostics: the TableGen frontend can successfully parse a

.td file that is syntactically valid from a TableGen perspective, while the C++ generation backend (specifically, OpDefinitionsGen) can still produce invalid C++ code because a semantic contract was violated.

The mlir-tblgen tool correctly validated that the records in OrchestraOps.td conformed to the TableGen syntax. However, the C++ code generator for operations makes certain assumptions based on the *presence* of specific components, such as OpTrait specializations. If an operation definition claims to use a trait but fails to provide the other components mandated by that trait's implicit contract, the generator may proceed to emit C++ code that is syntactically invalid because it contains unresolved dependencies or references to non-existent class members. There is not always a cross-validation step within mlir-tblgen to ensure that these semantic contracts are fulfilled before C++ code is written.

This behavior explains why the logical debugging steps undertaken previously—such as disabling canonicalization patterns—did not resolve the issue. The problem was not an error in the logic of the canonicalizers but a fundamental, structural flaw in an operation's definition that was completely unrelated to canonicalization. The only symptom of this flaw appeared much later, during C++ compilation, necessitating a different investigative approach: a direct, meticulous review of the TableGen definitions against the contracts imposed by the MLIR framework, combined with an inspection of the malformed generated code itself.

### **The Investigative Path Forward**

Given the nature of the silent failure, the most effective strategy is a line-by-line audit of the OrchestraOps.td file. The analysis must focus on definitions that employ complex MLIR features, as these impose the strictest and often most subtle contracts on the operation's structure. Traits, in particular, are powerful mechanisms that inject significant boilerplate code and functionality into the generated C++ class.2 A misuse of a trait is a prime suspect for this kind of build failure. This investigative path leads directly to an examination of

Orchestra\_CommitOp and its use of the AttrSizedOperandSegments trait.

## **A Deep Analysis of OrchestraOps.td and the AttrSizedOperandSegments Trait**

### **Initial Survey of Orchestra Operations**

A preliminary review of the operations defined in OrchestraOps.td helps to narrow the focus of the investigation.

* Orchestra\_ScheduleOp and Orchestra\_TaskOp: Both operations use the SingleBlock trait and define a single region. Their argument and result lists are straightforward. These definitions are standard and conform to common MLIR patterns.  
* Orchestra\_TransferOp: This operation uses the AllTypesMatch trait, a simple constraint that is correctly applied to its $source and $result. Its definition is structurally sound.  
* Orchestra\_YieldOp: This is a basic terminator operation using the Terminator trait with a single variadic operand group. This is a canonical and correct usage.

These operations are unlikely to be the source of a fundamental code generation error. The analysis, therefore, converges on Orchestra\_CommitOp, which has the most complex structure.

### **Converging on Orchestra\_CommitOp**

The definition of Orchestra\_CommitOp immediately stands out as the most probable source of the error. It declares two separate Variadic\<AnyType\> operand groups: $true\_values and $false\_values. When an operation has more than one variadic operand group, the MLIR framework cannot statically determine where one group ends and the next begins. To resolve this ambiguity at runtime, the operation must provide this segmentation information explicitly.1

The AttrSizedOperandSegments trait is the standard mechanism for this purpose. Its presence on Orchestra\_CommitOp is conceptually correct, as it signals the intent to manage the sizes of the $true\_values and $false\_values segments. However, the use of this trait is not merely declarative; it imposes a strict, non-negotiable contract on the operation's definition.

### **Unpacking the AttrSizedOperandSegments Trait Contract**

The AttrSizedOperandSegments trait is a powerful feature that automates the handling of operations with multiple variadic operand groups. It injects the necessary parsing, printing, verification, and accessor logic into the generated C++ class. However, for this automation to function correctly, the operation must provide the data source for the segment sizes.

The core, inviolable requirement of this trait is that the operation *must* define an attribute specifically named operandSegmentSizes. This attribute, typically of type DenseI32ArrayAttr or DenseI64ArrayAttr, stores an array of integers where each integer represents the number of operands in the corresponding segment. The auto-generated C++ code is hardwired to look for an attribute with this exact name and type to correctly partition the flat list of Value operands.4

This contract is consistently honored across all mature, in-tree MLIR dialects. For instance:

* The air dialect uses this trait for air.channel.get and air.channel.put to manage their various optional and variadic index and offset operands.5  
* The IREE compiler's iree\_linalg\_ext dialect uses it for custom\_op to differentiate between variadic ins and outs operands that are passed as a single operand list.6  
* The TensorFlow dialect's \_FusedConv2D operation uses it to manage a variadic list of args that follow the primary inputs.7

In all these cases, the pattern is identical: the presence of the AttrSizedOperandSegments trait is coupled with multiple variadic operand groups and the mandatory operandSegmentSizes attribute definition. The absence of this attribute in the Orchestra\_CommitOp definition represents a direct violation of this fundamental contract.

To make this implicit contract explicit, the following table summarizes its requirements.

| Requirement | Specification | Rationale / Consequence of Violation |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Mandatory Attribute** | The operation's arguments list must include a definition for an attribute named operandSegmentSizes. | This attribute provides the runtime information needed to delineate the variadic operand groups. Violation leads to mlir-tblgen generating C++ code with unresolved dependencies on methods related to this attribute, causing compile-time template errors. |
| **Attribute Type** | The attribute must be of a type that can hold an array of integers, typically DenseI32ArrayAttr. | The generated C++ helpers expect to call methods specific to integer array attributes (e.g., getValue(), size()) to retrieve the segment sizes. An incorrect type will lead to C++ type errors. |
| **Operand Structure** | The operation must define at least two operand groups, where at least one is variadic. The segments in the attribute correspond to the operand groups in order. | The trait's purpose is to manage the sizes of *multiple* segments. The number of integers in the attribute array must match the number of operand groups defined in the arguments list. |
| **Verification** | The trait injects a verifyTrait method that checks at runtime if the sum of the segment sizes in the attribute matches the total number of SSA value operands.4 | This is a runtime check for semantic correctness. The build failure occurs because the *compile-time* contract is violated before any runtime verification can be executed. |

## **The Precise Error: A Missing Attribute and its Cascade Failure**

### **Pinpointing the Omission in Orchestra\_CommitOp**

The root cause of the persistent build failure is now unequivocally identified: The definition of Orchestra\_CommitOp in OrchestraOps.td uses the AttrSizedOperandSegments trait but fails to declare the required operandSegmentSizes attribute in its arguments list.

Code-Snippet

// Problematic Definition  
def Orchestra\_CommitOp : Orchestra\_Op\<"commit",\> {  
  //...  
  let arguments \= (ins I1:$condition,  
                       Variadic\<AnyType\>:$true\_values,  
                       Variadic\<AnyType\>:$false\_values); // \<-- Missing attribute  
  //...  
}

This omission is a direct violation of the trait's contract, and it initiates a cascade of failures that culminates in the observed C++ compiler error.

### **Tracing the Generation Failure from.td to C++**

The path from this single missing line in the TableGen file to the cryptic C++ error can be traced through the compiler's build process. This sequence demonstrates how traits are not merely metadata tags but are invasive code injection mechanisms that fundamentally alter the generated C++ class.

1. **TableGen Processing:** The mlir-tblgen executable parses OrchestraOps.td. It encounters the Orchestra\_CommitOp definition and recognizes the AttrSizedOperandSegments trait. This recognition triggers a specialized code generation path within the OpDefinitionsGen backend. This path is designed to emit C++ code that can parse, print, build, and verify operations with segmented variadic operands.  
2. **C++ Class Generation:** The code generator begins to emit the C++ class definition for CommitOp into the OrchestraOps.h.inc file. Because the AttrSizedOperandSegments trait is present, the generator is hardcoded to emit method signatures and helper class specializations that depend on the existence of the operandSegmentSizes attribute. For example, it will generate code that attempts to call a getOperandSegmentSizes() accessor method on the CommitOp instance. However, because the attribute was not declared in the arguments list of the .td file, the generator does *not* create the underlying attribute storage or the getOperandSegmentSizes() accessor method within the CommitOp class definition. The result is an internally inconsistent C++ class: it has member functions and is used in templates that expect a certain interface, but that interface has not been fully generated.  
3. **Dialect Registration:** In OrchestraDialect.cpp, the dialect's C++ constructor calls addOperations\<Orchestra\_ScheduleOp, Orchestra\_TaskOp,..., Orchestra\_CommitOp,...\>(). This is a variadic template function that iterates over the list of operation types provided. For each operation, it instantiates various helper templates responsible for tasks like parsing and verification. These templates are designed to work with any well-formed MLIR operation class.  
4. **The C++ Compilation Error:** The C++ compiler processes OrchestraDialect.cpp. When it reaches the instantiation of addOperations and encounters Orchestra\_CommitOp in the template parameter list, it attempts to substitute Orchestra\_CommitOp into the various helper templates. At this point, the inconsistency created in step 2 becomes fatal. A helper template, specialized by the AttrSizedOperandSegments trait's logic, attempts to access a method or type definition (e.g., CommitOp::getOperandSegmentSizesAttr()) that does not exist on the generated Orchestra\_CommitOp class. This results in a hard template substitution failure. C++ compilers often struggle to produce clear error messages for complex template failures, reporting the issue as a generic parse error in template argument list, as the list of types is now considered invalid due to the non-conformant Orchestra\_CommitOp type.

This cascade failure highlights a crucial aspect of MLIR ODS design. Simple flags like hasVerifier \= 1 are low-risk; they typically enable or disable a single, well-defined feature. In contrast, complex traits like AttrSizedOperandSegments are high-risk, high-reward features. They are deeply "invasive," weaving a complex web of functionalities, dependencies, and expectations throughout the generated C++ class. Their use demands a complete and precise understanding of their associated contract to avoid subtle and difficult-to-diagnose build failures.

## **Corrective Implementation and Verification**

### **The Corrected TableGen Definition**

The solution is to modify the Orchestra\_CommitOp definition in OrchestraOps.td to fulfill the contract of the AttrSizedOperandSegments trait. This is achieved by adding the mandatory operandSegmentSizes attribute to the arguments list. The attribute should be of a type that can store an array of integers, with I32ArrayAttr being a standard choice.

The corrected definition is as follows:

Code-Snippet

def Orchestra\_CommitOp : Orchestra\_Op\<"commit",\> {  
  let summary \= "Selects one of two SSA values based on a boolean condition.";  
  let description \=;

  let arguments \= (ins I1:$condition,  
                       Variadic\<AnyType\>:$true\_values,  
                       Variadic\<AnyType\>:$false\_values,  
                       // This is the required attribute that was missing.  
                       // It holds the sizes of the variadic operand groups.  
                       // The number of elements in this array must be 3,  
                       // corresponding to \`condition\`, \`true\_values\`, and \`false\_values\`.  
                       I32ArrayAttr:$operandSegmentSizes);

  let results \= (outs Variadic\<AnyType\>:$results);

  let hasVerifier \= 1;

  let assemblyFormat \= "$condition \`true\` \`(\` $true\_values \`)\` \`false\` \`(\` $false\_values \`)\` attr-dict \`:\` functional-type(operands, results)";  
}

### **Explanation of the Correction**

By adding I32ArrayAttr:$operandSegmentSizes to the arguments list, the definition now provides all the information mlir-tblgen needs to generate a well-formed C++ class. The code generator will now:

1. Generate the correct storage for a DenseI32ArrayAttr named operandSegmentSizes within the CommitOp C++ class.  
2. Generate the corresponding getOperandSegmentSizes() and getOperandSegmentSizesAttr() accessor methods that the trait's injected code expects.  
3. Generate well-formed C++ code in all helper classes and methods, as their dependencies on the CommitOp class interface are now satisfied.

The operandSegmentSizes attribute will hold an array with three integers. For an instance of CommitOp, this array would look like {1, N, M}, where 1 is the size of the $condition segment, N is the size of the $true\_values segment, and M is the size of the $false\_values segment.

### **Updating the Assembly Format**

A necessary consequence of adding an attribute is considering its representation in the textual IR format. The AttrSizedOperandSegments trait provides default parsing and printing logic that expects to find the operandSegmentSizes attribute in the operation's attribute dictionary. The provided assemblyFormat string already includes the attr-dict directive, which is the correct approach. This directive instructs the parser/printer to handle all attributes that are not explicitly named in the format string, which includes the special operandSegmentSizes attribute. No changes to the assemblyFormat are strictly necessary, but it is crucial to ensure attr-dict is present.

### **Verification Steps**

To verify the fix, the following steps should be performed:

1. Apply the corrected definition for Orchestra\_CommitOp to the orchestra-compiler/include/Orchestra/OrchestraOps.td file.  
2. Delete the build directory to ensure a clean rebuild and prevent stale generated files from interfering.  
3. Execute the project's build command (e.g., cmake \--build. or ninja).  
4. The mlir-tblgen command will now execute successfully, generating a correct OrchestraOps.h.inc file where the Orchestra::CommitOp class is complete and well-formed.  
5. The C++ compilation of OrchestraDialect.cpp will subsequently succeed, as the Orchestra::CommitOp type now satisfies all requirements of the templates used within the addOperations function. The build failure will be resolved.

## **Investigation into MLIR v20 Regressions and Breaking Changes**

### **Addressing the Secondary Question**

A thorough investigation was conducted to determine if a bug or breaking change in the MLIR v20 toolchain could be responsible for this behavior. This involved reviewing official MLIR release notes, deprecation announcements, and documentation related to TableGen and operation definition.

### **Analysis of MLIR Release Notes (v18-v20)**

The release notes for recent LLVM versions highlight several major changes in MLIR, but none are related to the issue at hand.8

* **Properties:** The most significant architectural change is the introduction of "Properties" as an alternative to attributes for storing an operation's inherent data.9 While this is a major feature that became default in LLVM 18, it is not the cause of this failure. The  
  AttrSizedOperandSegments trait is explicitly designed to work with an *attribute* named operandSegmentSizes. The failure is due to the *absence* of this required attribute, a problem that would exist regardless of whether the Properties feature was enabled.  
* **Other Changes:** Other notable changes, such as the deprecation of OpBuilder::create in favor of static OpTy::create methods, the migration to opaque pointers in the LLVM dialect, and the removal of legacy GPU compilation passes, are entirely orthogonal to the ODS C++ code generation for a custom dialect's operations.8 They affect different parts of the MLIR API and infrastructure.

There is no evidence in the official release announcements or deprecation lists of any change to the contract or implementation of the AttrSizedOperandSegments trait that would cause this build failure in MLIR v20.

### **Conclusion: Not a Regression, but a Contract Violation**

The definitive conclusion is that the build failure is not the result of a bug, regression, or breaking change in MLIR v20. The behavior of mlir-tblgen in this scenario is consistent with the long-standing design of the ODS framework. The contract for AttrSizedOperandSegments—requiring the explicit definition of an operandSegmentSizes attribute—has been stable and is fundamental to its operation.

The failure stems from an incorrect usage of the ODS framework. The confusing nature of the C++ error message is a consequence of the diagnostic gap in mlir-tblgen, which validates TableGen syntax but not the full semantic contract between an operation and its traits before generating C++ code. The provided fix is therefore robust and correct, not a workaround for a transient toolchain issue.

## **Broader Implications and Best Practices for ODS**

This diagnostic exercise provides several valuable lessons that can be synthesized into a set of best practices for developing and debugging MLIR dialects. Adopting these principles can help prevent similar issues and accelerate the resolution of future problems.

### **Proactive Debugging of TableGen Issues**

* **Principle 1: Trust, but Verify the Generated Code.** When a C++ compiler fails inside a .inc file or in code that uses types from a .inc file, the first step should be to inspect the generated code directly. Open the relevant .h.inc and .cpp.inc files and search for the definition of the problematic operation class. Compare its structure—member variables, methods, inherited classes—to a known-good operation from a core MLIR dialect. This is the most direct and effective way to diagnose silent mlir-tblgen failures, as the generated code is the ultimate ground truth.  
* **Principle 2: Treat Traits as Invasive Contracts.** Before using any non-trivial trait (i.e., anything more complex than a simple marker like Terminator), it is essential to understand its full contract. Consult the official MLIR documentation, including the Doxygen pages for the trait's C++ implementation and the .td source file where the OpTrait is defined (often in OpBase.td or similar). Assume that a trait may require more than just adding its name to the trait list; it may impose requirements on the operation's arguments, results, or attributes.  
* **Principle 3: Use In-Tree Dialects as Canonical Examples.** The LLVM/MLIR repository is the ultimate source of truth and contains a wealth of production-quality examples. When implementing a new operation or using a new feature, find an analogous operation in a core dialect (linalg, func, arith, scf, memref) and study its .td definition. This practice is often faster and more reliable than relying on documentation alone, as it demonstrates the correct, tested usage patterns.  
* **Principle 4: Isolate and Minimize.** When a build fails after modifying a .td file, apply a systematic isolation strategy. If a specific operation is suspected, comment out its entire def block. If the build then succeeds, the issue is within that block. Re-introduce the operation's components incrementally—first the name and summary, then the arguments, then the results, and finally the traits—rebuilding at each step. This methodical process will pinpoint the exact line or feature that is causing the failure. The previous attempt to isolate the canonicalizer was a good instinct, but the scope of isolation should have been applied to the entire CommitOp definition itself.

### **Final Summary**

The investigation successfully identified the root cause of the build failure as a subtle but critical contract violation in the TableGen definition of Orchestra\_CommitOp. The use of the AttrSizedOperandSegments trait without the corresponding mandatory I32ArrayAttr:$operandSegmentSizes attribute led mlir-tblgen to generate a malformed C++ class, which in turn caused a fatal template substitution failure during C++ compilation. The issue is not a regression in MLIR v20 but a long-standing requirement of the ODS framework. The provided correction, which adds the missing attribute, is a complete and robust solution. By adopting the best practices outlined above, developers can more effectively navigate the complexities of MLIR's TableGen-based operation definition system and prevent similar issues in future development.
