# A Developer's Guide to Debugging MLIR Verifier Issues

This guide provides a practical, step-by-step walkthrough of a real-world debugging scenario encountered in the OrchestraOS compiler project. It aims to capture the process and key insights gained while resolving a complex verifier instability issue with the `orchestra.commit` operation.

## The Initial Problem: A Failing Verifier Test

The initial symptom was a failing test case, `verify-commit.mlir`. This test was designed to ensure that the verifier for `orchestra.commit` correctly rejected various forms of invalid IR. However, the test was failing because the expected diagnostic errors were *not* being produced.

This indicated a fundamental problem with the verifier itself: it was not catching bugs it was designed to catch.

## Step 1: Initial Hypotheses and Dead Ends

Early investigation focused on the operation's definition in TableGen (`OrchestraOps.td`). Several hypotheses were tested, most of which turned out to be incorrect but were essential in narrowing down the problem space.

*   **Hypothesis 1: Missing Trait.** The `SameVariadicOperandSize` trait was present, but perhaps it required the `AttrSizedOperandSegments` trait to function. **Result:** This was incorrect. Adding both traits resulted in a build failure, as they are mutually exclusive.
*   **Hypothesis 2: C++ Verifier Conflict.** Perhaps the custom C++ `verify()` method was overriding the verifier provided by the `SameVariadicOperandSize` trait. **Result:** Removing the C++ verifier did not solve the problem; it resulted in *no* verification being run at all.

These initial steps, while unsuccessful, demonstrated that the issue was more subtle than a simple configuration error in the TableGen definitions.

## Step 2: The Breakthrough: Print-Based Debugging

When in doubt, print. The breakthrough came from adding classic `llvm::errs()` print statements to the C++ `verify()` method in `OrchestraOps.cpp`.

```cpp
mlir::LogicalResult CommitOp::verify() {
  llvm::errs() << "Verifying CommitOp: " << getOperationName() << "\n";
  llvm::errs() << "  True values size: " << getTrueValues().size() << "\n";
  llvm::errs() << "  False values size: " << getFalseValues().size() << "\n";
  // ... rest of the verifier
}
```

Running the test with these prints revealed the "smoking gun":
For an op like `%0 = orchestra.commit %cond true(%t1) false(%f1, %f2)`, the output was:
```
Verifying CommitOp: orchestra.commit
  True values size: 1
  False values size: 1
```
This was clearly wrong. The verifier thought the `false_values` operand segment had a size of 1, when it was clearly 2 in the MLIR source. This definitively proved that the problem was not in the verifier's logic, but in the **parser**. The parser was not correctly segmenting the variadic operands.

## Step 3: Fixing the Parser and Its Consequences

The fix for the parser was to use the `AttrSizedOperandSegments` trait on the `Orchestra_CommitOp`. This trait automatically adds an attribute to the operation that tells the parser how to segment the variadic operands. With this trait in place, the parser worked correctly.

However, this fix introduced a new set of failures in other tests (`lower-commit.mlir`, `canonicalize-commit.mlir`).

**The Cause:** These test files were using the generic assembly format for `orchestra.commit` (e.g., `"%0 = "orchestra.commit"(...)"`). When an op uses `AttrSizedOperandSegments`, the generic parser requires the `operandSegmentSizes` attribute to be explicitly present in the IR.

**The Fix:** The solution was to update the affected test files to use the more readable custom assembly format, which does not have this issue.

## Step 4: The Final Hurdle: Fixing the Test Harness

After fixing the parser and the test files, the `verify-commit.mlir` test was *still* failing. However, running `orchestra-opt` on the file directly showed that the first invalid case was now correctly producing an error.

**The Cause:** The test runner, `lit`, was executing `orchestra-opt` on the entire file. The tool would encounter the first error, report it, and exit. `lit` would then check if all `expected-error` directives in the file were satisfied. Since the tool exited early, the directives for the later test cases were never checked, causing the test to fail.

**The Fix:** The standard MLIR solution for this is to split the test file into multiple independent chunks that the runner can process separately. This is done by:
1.  Adding the `--split-input-file` flag to the `RUN` line of the test.
2.  Adding `// -----` separators between each test case (i.e., between each `func.func`).

With this final change, all test cases were processed correctly, and the entire test suite passed.

## Key Takeaways

*   **Trust, but Verify Your Parser:** When a verifier behaves unexpectedly, do not assume the verifier logic is wrong. Use print statements to check what the verifier is actually seeing. The problem may be further upstream in the parser.
*   **Custom Assembly is Your Friend:** Using a custom assembly format makes IR more readable and can avoid issues with the generic parser, especially for ops with complex operand structures.
*   **Test One Thing at a Time:** When writing verifier tests with multiple invalid cases, always use `--split-input-file` and separators to ensure each case is tested independently. This prevents a cascading failure where one error masks all the others.
