## **Part 1: Foundational Principles of MLIR Verification**

This part establishes the foundational principles of the MLIR verification system. It moves beyond a simple description of rules to explain the core architectural philosophy that enables MLIR's most powerful features: composability and progressive lowering. A deep understanding of these principles is a prerequisite for designing robust, maintainable, and correct dialects.

### **1.1 The Verifier's Contract: Enforcing Dialect Invariants**

In the MLIR ecosystem, a verifier is the ultimate arbiter of correctness for a dialect's invariants. It is not merely a debugging aid but a core component of the compiler's architecture, acting as an inviolable contract that is enforced before and after every transformation pass.1 This transactional guarantee—that the Intermediate Representation (IR) remains in a well-formed state throughout the compilation pipeline—is a cornerstone of MLIR's design. It frees pass authors from the burden of writing defensive code to handle malformed or unexpected IR structures, as they can rely on the strong invariants guaranteed by the verifiers of the operations they are processing.1

#### **The Philosophy of Local Verification**

The central architectural principle governing all MLIR verifiers is that they must be **local**. An operation's verifier is responsible for enforcing the invariants of a single operation instance in isolation, without knowledge of the broader context in which the operation appears.1 This is not an arbitrary limitation but a deliberate design choice that underpins MLIR's modularity, dialect composability, and the entire progressive lowering compilation strategy.1

#### **Why Inter-Operation Checks are an Anti-Pattern**

A common architectural error for new dialect designers is to embed checks about an operation's context into its local verifier. For instance, a verifier for an orchestra.commit operation must not check if its operands are produced by orchestra.task operations. Such a check creates a rigid, structural dependency between two distinct operations, fundamentally violating MLIR's design principles. This type of inter-operation check is an anti-pattern for two primary reasons 1:

1. **Breaking Dialect Composability**: MLIR's strength lies in its ability to mix operations from different dialects within the same function.1 An  
   orchestra.commit operation might legitimately need to select between values produced by scf.if, arith.select, or an operation from a completely unforeseen dialect. Hard-coding a dependency on orchestra.task would render these valid use cases invalid, crippling the utility and reusability of the operation. The design of robust dialects, such as the OpenACC dialect, follows a "dialect agnostic" model, using interfaces to verify properties where needed rather than creating direct dependencies on other dialects' operations.1  
2. **Obstructing Progressive Lowering**: MLIR-based compilers function by progressively lowering the IR from high-level, abstract dialects to lower-level, hardware-specific ones.1 Consider a compilation pipeline where an early pass lowers all  
   orchestra.task operations to a more generic async.execute. A subsequent pass is then intended to optimize orchestra.commit. If the commit verifier required its inputs to be from orchestra.task, the IR would become invalid the moment the first pass completes. The verifier that runs automatically before the second pass would fail, halting the compilation pipeline. This creates a brittle, order-dependent system. By keeping verification strictly local, each operation remains valid on its own terms, allowing passes to incrementally transform the IR without causing cascading verification failures.1

#### **The Correct Tool for Global Invariants: Analysis Passes**

While inter-operation checks are inappropriate for a local verify() method, they are often necessary to enforce higher-level program semantics. A rule such as "every orchestra.commit must be fed by an orchestra.task" might be a valid invariant for a well-formed program at a specific stage of compilation. These are considered global or inter-procedural invariants.

The correct place to enforce these rules is in a dedicated analysis or verification pass, not within an individual operation's verifier.1 A compiler developer can create an

orchestra-invariants-verifier pass that runs at a specific point in the pipeline to check these higher-level semantic constraints. This approach cleanly separates two distinct concerns:

* **Local Structural Integrity**: The responsibility of op-\>verify(). This ensures that an operation is well-formed in and of itself.  
* **Global Program Semantics**: The responsibility of a dedicated analysis or verification pass. This ensures that a collection of individually valid operations forms a semantically correct program according to the dialect's rules.

MLIR provides a rich pass infrastructure and analysis management framework precisely for this purpose, allowing for the clean separation of these concerns.1

### **1.2 The Verification Gauntlet: A Precise Execution Order**

The verification of an MLIR operation is not a monolithic check but a multi-stage, "fail-fast" gauntlet. The process is automatically invoked by the pass manager and is designed with a strictly ordered sequence of checks, where each stage builds upon the guarantees of the previous ones.1 Understanding this precise order is fundamental to correctly diagnosing and resolving many verifier-related issues. Upon detecting the first violation, the verification sequence for that operation is immediately aborted, the diagnostic from the failing stage is emitted, and all subsequent stages are skipped.1

This layered approach is a deliberate design pattern. It allows verifiers at later stages to assume that basic structural properties have already been validated, simplifying their logic and allowing them to focus on more complex semantic invariants. The verification pipeline is a dependency graph for correctness; a verifier at stage N does not need to re-check what was validated at stage N−1. This implies a best practice: place verification logic at the earliest possible stage where it can be expressed. Use ODS constraints for simple type checks, traits for common cross-operand checks, and reserve the custom C++ verify() for truly unique, complex logic. This minimizes handwritten code and leverages the most robust, auto-generated parts of the system.

The six stages of verification are executed in the following deterministic order 1:

1. **Stage 1: Internal & Structural Traits**: The first checks to run are those associated with fundamental structural traits that enforce the most basic properties of the IR. Examples include traits that verify region properties, such as ensuring a block is correctly terminated (or explicitly not terminated via OpTrait::NoTerminator).1 These checks guarantee that the operation is structurally sound enough for subsequent, more detailed analysis.  
2. **Stage 2: ODS Invariants (verifyInvariants)**: Following the structural checks, MLIR executes the verifiers that are automatically generated by the Operation Definition Specification (ODS) system via mlir-tblgen. This stage is responsible for validating the constraints declared in the arguments and results sections of an operation's .td file, such as the correct number of operands and results for non-variadic cases, the presence of required attributes, and adherence to basic type constraints.1  
3. **Stage 3: General Operation Traits (verifyTrait)**: This stage is where the verifiers associated with most general-purpose operation traits are executed. Traits are a primary mechanism for code reuse in MLIR, and when a trait provides a verification hook, it is implemented as a verifyTrait method.1 This is the stage where a trait like  
   SameVariadicOperandSize runs its verifier, checking relationships between different operands or results.  
4. **Stage 4: Custom Operation Verifier (verify())**: Only after an operation has successfully passed the preceding three stages does its custom, handwritten verifier execute. This verifier is enabled by setting let hasVerifier \= 1; in the operation's .td definition and implementing the verify() method in C++.1 It is the intended location for complex, operation-specific semantic invariants that are too nuanced to express declaratively.  
5. **Stage 5: Region-Aware Traits (verifyRegionTrait)**: For operations that contain regions, there is a second phase of verification that handles invariants related to the nested IR. This stage executes verifiers from traits that need to inspect the contents of an operation's regions (marked with verifyWithRegions=1).1 A key feature of this stage is that it runs after all the operations within the nested regions have themselves been fully verified, ensuring that a  
   verifyRegionTrait hook can safely traverse the region's operations.  
6. **Stage 6: Custom Region Verifier (verifyRegions())**: The final stage is the custom region verifier, enabled by let hasRegionVerifier \= 1;. This allows for handwritten C++ code in a verifyRegions() method to check complex invariants that span the parent operation and the contents of its regions, again with the guarantee that all nested operations have already been verified.1

This strict, hierarchical ordering is the key to understanding many verifier behaviors. The following table provides a consolidated reference for this verification pipeline, which is an invaluable tool for debugging. When a verifier fails, a developer can use this table to form a hypothesis about where in the pipeline the failure occurred based on the nature of the error, dramatically speeding up the diagnostic process.

| Stage | Source of Logic | C++ Hook Invoked | Typical Invariants Checked |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **1** | Internal/Structural Traits | verifyTrait (for specific traits) | Region termination, SSA properties, basic structural integrity. |
| **2** | ODS Constraints | verifyInvariants (generated) | Operand/result counts for fixed-size groups, attribute presence, basic TableGen type constraints. |
| **3** | General Op Traits | verifyTrait | Cross-operand properties (e.g., same size for variadic groups, same element type). |
| **4** | Custom C++ Code | verify() | Complex, operation-specific semantic invariants not covered by traits or ODS. |
| **5** | Region-Aware Traits | verifyRegionTrait | Invariants between an operation and its nested, already-verified regions. |
| **6** | Custom Region Code | verifyRegions() | Custom, operation-specific invariants involving nested regions. |

## **Part 2: Authoring Operation Verifiers**

This part transitions from the foundational principles of verification to the practical, step-by-step process of implementing verifiers for various classes of operations. The tutorials provided are updated with modern MLIR idioms and best practices relevant for the v20 release cycle.

### **2.1 Implementing a Basic Verifier**

This tutorial covers the creation of a verifier for a simple operation that does not contain regions. The process involves declaring the verifier in TableGen and implementing its logic in C++.

* **Step 1: TableGen Definition**: The first step is to signal to the Operation Definition Specification (ODS) framework that a custom C++ verifier will be provided. This is done by adding let hasVerifier \= 1; to the operation's definition in its .td file. This directive instructs mlir-tblgen to generate the necessary C++ method declaration for the verifier hook.1  
* **Step 2: C++ Implementation**: With the hook declared, the next step is to implement the LogicalResult verify() method in the operation's C++ source file. This method provides the context of the operation instance being verified, allowing access to its operands, attributes, and results. The implementation should check the desired invariants and return mlir::success() if they are met, or mlir::failure() if a violation is detected.1  
* **Step 3: Emitting Errors**: When an invariant is violated and the verifier returns mlir::failure(), it is essential to also emit a diagnostic message explaining the problem. The standard way to do this is by calling emitOpError("...") on the operation instance. This method reports an error and returns an InFlightDiagnostic object, which can be implicitly converted to mlir::failure().1

### **2.2 Advanced Verification: Semantic Type Compatibility**

A production-quality verifier must often go beyond simple, brittle checks. For operations that are polymorphic or part of an extensible type system, verifying semantic type compatibility is a critical requirement.

#### **The Insufficiency of Pointer Equality**

A common but naive approach to type checking is to compare mlir::TypeRange objects directly, for example, via getTrueValues().getTypes()\!= getFalseValues().getTypes(). This ultimately relies on pointer equality of the underlying uniqued mlir::Type instances in the MLIRContext.1 This check is computationally efficient but semantically shallow and fails in several important scenarios 1:

* **Asymmetric Compatibility**: Consider a dialect with a future\<T\> type. A valid use case might be to select between a value of type orchestra.future\<f32\> and a value of type f32, with the result being orchestra.future\<f32\>. This implies an implicit promotion of the f32 value. A verifier demanding strict equality would incorrectly reject this valid construct.  
* **Shape Refinement**: In tensor-based dialects, compatibility often involves shape information. An operation might be valid if it merges a tensor\<10x?xf32\> and a tensor\<?x20xf32\> to produce a tensor\<10x20xf32\>. The types are not equal, but they are compatible, and their combination yields a more refined result.  
* **Type Aliases and Equivalence**: Different dialects or stages of lowering might represent semantically equivalent concepts with distinct Type classes. A robust verifier should reason about this equivalence rather than being tied to a specific representation.

#### **The Idiomatic Solution: Type Interfaces**

To implement deep semantic checking in a maintainable and extensible way, the idiomatic MLIR approach is to define and use a TypeInterface.1 Interfaces provide a virtual contract that different types can implement, decoupling the operation's verifier from the specific compatibility logic of every type in the system. This avoids a brittle, monolithic helper function with a large

switch or if/else if chain of dyn\_cast calls, which would violate the Open/Closed principle.1

The process involves three steps:

1. **Define the Interface in TableGen**: A new TypeInterface is defined in a .td file. This interface declares the methods that compatible types must implement. For example, a TypeCompatibilityInterface could define a verifyCommitCompatibility method.1  
   Code-Snippet  
   // In OrchestraInterfaces.td  
   def Orchestra\_TypeCompatibilityInterface :  
     TypeInterface\<"TypeCompatibility"\> {  
     let cppNamespace \= "::orchestra";  
     let methods \=;  
   }

2. **Implement the Interface for Types**: Each relevant type in the dialect then implements this interface, typically via an external model in its C++ source file. This decentralizes the compatibility logic. A simple type like f32 might enforce strict equality, while a custom FutureType could implement more complex, domain-specific logic allowing compatibility with its underlying element type.1  
3. **Integrate with the Verifier**: The operation's verify() method is then simplified and future-proofed. It no longer contains type-specific logic. Instead, it attempts to dyn\_cast an operand's type to the interface. If the cast succeeds, it dispatches the check to the interface method. If not, it can fall back to a default behavior, such as strict equality. This design creates a robust and extensible system that can evolve as new types are added to the dialect without requiring modification to existing verifiers.1

### **2.3 Advanced Verification: Handling Variadic Operations**

Variadic operations, which accept a variable number of operands using Variadic\<...\> in ODS, introduce unique verification challenges.

#### **The Build-Time Mandate**

When an operation has more than one variadic operand group, the ODS framework faces an ambiguity: given a flat list of SSA values at runtime, it does not inherently know how to partition them into the distinct variadic groups. To resolve this, mlir-tblgen enforces a build-time mandate that such operations must use a trait that provides a segmentation strategy.1

#### **A Tale of Two Traits: SameVariadicOperandSize vs. AttrSizedOperandSegments**

MLIR provides two primary traits to solve this problem. The choice between them is an architectural trade-off between convenience and control.

* **SameVariadicOperandSize**: This trait signals to mlir-tblgen that all variadic operand groups will have the same number of elements, resolving the parsing ambiguity. However, it has a dual role: it also injects a runtime verifier at Stage 3 of the verification pipeline that enforces this same-size constraint.1 While this automated verification is convenient, it comes at a cost: the diagnostic message it emits is generic (e.g., "  
  \<op-name\>' op variadic operand sizes must be equal") and cannot be customized. This can lead to opaque error messages and failing tests that expect a more specific diagnostic, as it preempts any custom size-check logic in a Stage 4 verify() method.1  
* **AttrSizedOperandSegments**: This trait provides an alternative segmentation strategy. It requires the operation instance to carry an integer array attribute (typically named operandSegmentSizes) that explicitly specifies the size of each operand segment.1 This solves the build-time parsing problem but, crucially,  
  **does not** inject a runtime verifier. This gives the developer full control over verification logic and diagnostic messages. The size check can be implemented manually inside the custom verify() method, allowing for a semantically rich, operation-specific error message. The trade-off is the addition of structural overhead to the IR in the form of the size attribute.1

#### **Edge Case Handling: The Zero-Operand Scenario**

A critical edge case for variadic operations is the "zero-instance" scenario, where the variadic operand groups are empty. The verifier must have a clear policy for this case.1 There are two interpretations:

1. **Argument for Invalid**: The operation's purpose is to select values. If there are no values to select, it is not fulfilling its semantic purpose, and forbidding this form could catch logical errors in upstream passes earlier.  
2. **Argument for Valid (No-Op)**: Treating the zero-operand, zero-result form as a valid no-op can significantly simplify other compiler transformations. For example, a canonicalization pass might determine that all values selected by an operation are unused. The simplest implementation would be to remove the operands, leaving the operation empty. A separate, simple dead code elimination pass can then easily identify and remove these no-op instances.1

The recommended and more flexible approach is generally to allow the zero-operand, zero-result case as a valid no-op. This leads to a cleaner, more modular compiler design by decoupling transformations from the responsibility of cleaning up the operations they modify. The verifier should contain an explicit check to recognize and permit this specific case before proceeding to other checks.1

C++

// In a custom verify() method...  
if (getResults().empty()) {  
  // This is the zero-result case. If operands are also empty, it's a  
  // valid no-op.  
  return mlir::success();  
}

## **Part 3: The Art of Actionable Diagnostics**

A production-quality compiler must do more than simply reject invalid code; it must provide error messages that are clear, precise, and actionable. MLIR's diagnostic system is designed to enable this level of rich feedback, transforming the compiler from a mere validator into a powerful debugging assistant. This reflects a core design philosophy in MLIR that emphasizes developer experience.1

### **3.1 Mastering the Diagnostic Engine**

The MLIR diagnostic system is centered around a few key classes 10:

* **DiagnosticEngine**: The central controller that manages the registration of diagnostic handlers and the core API for emission.  
* **Diagnostic**: A class containing all the information for a single diagnostic message, including its location, severity, and arguments.  
* **InFlightDiagnostic**: An RAII (Resource Acquisition Is Initialization) wrapper around a Diagnostic that is being constructed. It allows for modification of the diagnostic before it is finalized and automatically reports it when it goes out of scope.

While diagnostics can be emitted directly through the DiagnosticEngine, the preferred and most convenient methods are those available on mlir::Operation. Methods like emitError(), emitWarning(), and emitRemark() automatically use the location attached to the operation, correctly scoping the diagnostic message.1 The

emitOpError() variant additionally prefixes the message with "'op-name' op", providing useful context.1

### **3.2 Beyond emitOpError: Crafting Rich Diagnostics with InFlightDiagnostic**

The emitOpError() method and its variants return an InFlightDiagnostic object.1 This object represents a diagnostic that has been created but not yet emitted. While it is "in flight," it can be modified to build a more detailed and helpful message. The

InFlightDiagnostic class supports a stream-style insertion operator (\<\<), allowing for the composition of complex messages from various components, including strings, types, attributes, SSA values, and even other operations.1

This allows the primary error message to be much more descriptive than a static string. For example:

C++

return emitOpError() \<\< "requires compatible types for 'true' and 'false' "  
                     \<\< "value pairs; mismatch found at index " \<\< i;

### **3.3 Pinpointing Errors with attachNote**

The most powerful feature for creating actionable diagnostics is InFlightDiagnostic::attachNote.1 A "note" is a secondary diagnostic message that is attached to the primary error. Crucially, a note can have its own source location, different from the location of the primary error. This allows the verifier to point directly to the source of invalid or conflicting IR constructs, guiding the developer to the precise locations of the problem.

This technique is used effectively throughout the MLIR codebase. For instance, the verifier for scf.if will attach a note pointing to the specific terminator operation if a block within its region is missing one, guiding the user directly to the source of the structural error.1

A multi-step diagnostic process using notes can transform the developer experience. For a type mismatch in an orchestra.commit operation, the process is:

1. Emit the primary error on the orchestra.commit operation itself to establish the context of the failure.  
2. Use attachNote() to add a note that explicitly states the incompatible types involved.  
3. Attach a second note, providing the location of the first operand via value1.getLoc(). The note's message can be "'true' branch value defined here."  
4. Attach a third note pointing to the location of the second operand via value2.getLoc() with a similar message.

The difference in developer experience is profound.

**Before (Baseline Verifier):**

error: 'orchestra.commit' op requires 'true' and 'false' value types to match

This message states the rule that was violated but provides no context. The developer must manually inspect the IR, trace the operands, and determine which pair of types was mismatched.

**After (Advanced Verifier with Notes):**

error: 'orchestra.commit' op requires compatible types for 'true' and 'false' value pairs; mismatch found at index 2  
note: type 'orchestra.future\<f32\>' is not compatible with type 'i32'  
note: 'true' branch value defined here: /path/to/source.mlir:15:8  
note: 'false' branch value defined here: /path/to/source.mlir:22:12

This advanced diagnostic transforms the compiler from a simple validator into a debugging assistant. It not only states the problem (mismatch found at index 2\) but also presents the specific evidence (the incompatible types) and points to the exact locations of that evidence in the source IR.1 This dramatically reduces the cognitive load on the developer, enabling them to identify and fix bugs far more quickly. Investing in the verifier's error reporting has a compounding effect on project-wide developer velocity and is a hallmark of high-quality compiler engineering.

## **Part 4: Verifying Region-Based Operations**

Operations that contain regions of code, such as those representing control flow or other scoped constructs, introduce significant verification complexities. Correctly architecting verifiers for these operations requires a deep understanding of MLIR's phased verification pipeline and the mechanisms for managing data flow into nested scopes.

### **4.1 A Tale of Two Hooks: verify() vs. verifyRegions()**

The choice between using let hasVerifier \= 1; (which generates the LogicalResult verify() method) and let hasRegionVerifier \= 1; (which generates LogicalResult verifyRegions()) in TableGen is a critical architectural decision for region-based operations.1 Selecting the incorrect hook can lead to verifiers that are either unable to perform necessary checks or that run at an inappropriate time, potentially relying on un-validated IR.

This choice is dictated by the phased verification pipeline detailed in Part 1\.

* **let hasVerifier \= 1; (verify())**: This method is executed during **Phase 1** of verification, *before* the contents of the operation's regions are traversed and verified.1 It is the correct choice for invariants that can be checked by looking only at the operation's own operands, attributes, and results. For instance, a verifier checking that an integer attribute falls within a specific range would use this hook.  
* **let hasRegionVerifier \= 1; (verifyRegions())**: This method is executed at the end of **Phase 2**, *after* all nested operations within any attached regions have been fully verified.1 It is the  
  **only correct choice** for invariants that depend on the contents of the regions. Any check that needs to inspect a region's terminator, validate the types of its block arguments, or enforce structural properties of the region itself falls into this category.

The guarantee provided by the verifyRegions() hook is fundamental: when it is called, the MLIR infrastructure ensures that all operations nested within its regions have already passed their own full verification pipeline. The author of verifyRegions() does not need to re-verify the internal consistency of nested operations; they can assume those operations are well-formed. The sole responsibility of verifyRegions() is to validate the *relationship* between the parent operation and its immediate children and the structure of its regions.1

The following table provides a clear guide for selecting the appropriate verifier hook. This decision is crucial, as attempting to inspect region contents from within a verify() method is an architectural error that relies on un-validated IR.

| Feature | let hasVerifier \= 1; | let hasRegionVerifier \= 1; |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Generated C++ Method** | LogicalResult verify() | LogicalResult verifyRegions() |
| **Execution Point** | Before the contents of any attached regions are verified. | After all operations within any attached regions have been fully verified. |
| **Typical Use Case** | Verifying properties of operands, attributes, and results. Enforcing constraints that are independent of region contents. | Verifying properties of operations inside the regions (e.g., terminators). Validating the relationship between the parent operation's operands/results and the region's block arguments/terminator operands. Enforcing structural properties of the region itself (e.g., block count). |

### **4.2 Managing Data Flow: Isolation and Block Arguments**

There are two primary models for regions in MLIR, each with different rules for data flow that the verifier must understand and enforce.

#### **Hermetic Scopes with IsolatedFromAbove**

The IsolatedFromAbove trait makes a powerful assertion: the regions an operation contains are hermetically sealed from the surrounding SSA scope.1 No operation inside an isolated region is permitted to directly use an SSA value that is defined outside of that region. The canonical example is

func::FuncOp, which defines a self-contained unit of code.1 The only way for data to enter a function's region is through its function arguments, which are modeled as the block arguments of the function's entry block. Misapplying this isolation principle to control-flow operations that require data flow from their parent scope is a common source of bugs in custom verifiers.1

#### **Structured Data Flow with Non-Isolated Regions**

The correct model for operations representing structured control flow (like scf.if, scf.for, or the user's orchestra.speculate) is that of a non-isolated region.1 These operations serve as the primary mechanism in MLIR for representing structured data flow into nested scopes.

In this pattern, the operation itself has a set of SSA operands that provide the actual values to be passed into the region. These operands are mapped to the region's block arguments, which serve as the formal parameters for the nested code block.1 This creates a clean, explicit channel for data to flow into the region. The verifier's role is not to forbid these arguments but to enforce the type consistency between the operation's operands and the region's block arguments, analogous to a C++ compiler checking the types of arguments at a function call site against the function's parameter types.1

### **4.3 Tutorial: Implementing a Verifier for a Region-Based Operation**

This section provides a complete, production-ready implementation for verifying the orchestra.speculate operation, a non-isolated, single-block region operation.

#### **Step 1: TableGen Definition**

Correctness begins with a precise declarative definition in ODS. The orchestra.speculate operation must be defined with its variadic operands and results, a region, and the critical hasRegionVerifier property.1

Code-Snippet

// In OrchestraOps.td  
def Orchestra\_SpeculateOp : Orchestra\_Op\<"speculate", \[  
    //... other traits...  
  \]\> {  
  let summary \= "Executes a region of code speculatively";  
  let arguments \= (ins Variadic\<AnyType\>:$region\_operands);  
  let results \= (outs Variadic\<AnyType\>:$results);  
  let regions \= (region SizedRegion:$speculation\_region);

  // Signal to ODS that we are providing a custom C++ verifier that  
  // needs to inspect the contents of the region. This generates the  
  // verifyRegions() hook.  
  let hasRegionVerifier \= 1;  
}

def Orchestra\_YieldOp : Orchestra\_Op\<"yield",\> {  
  let summary \= "Yields values from an Orchestra region-based operation";  
  let arguments \= (ins Variadic\<AnyType\>:$operands);  
}

#### **Step 2: C++ verifyRegions() Implementation**

With the TableGen definition in place, the verifyRegions() method is implemented in C++. This method systematically checks each of the required invariants for a well-formed speculate operation.1

C++

// In OrchestraOps.cpp  
mlir::LogicalResult SpeculateOp::verifyRegions() {  
  // Check 1: Verify region and block structure. The \`SizedRegion\`  
  // constraint in TableGen already enforces one region, but we can be  
  // explicit about the block structure.  
  Region \&region \= getSpeculationRegion();  
  if (region.empty()) {  
    return emitOpError("region must not be empty");  
  }  
  if (\!llvm::hasSingleElement(region)) {  
    return emitOpError("region is expected to have a single block");  
  }  
  Block \&entryBlock \= region.front();

  // Check 2: Verify operand-to-argument type mapping.  
  if (getRegionOperands().size()\!= entryBlock.getNumArguments()) {  
    return emitOpError("has an incorrect number of region operands (")  
           \<\< getRegionOperands().size()  
           \<\< ") that does not match the number of block arguments ("  
           \<\< entryBlock.getNumArguments() \<\< ")";  
  }  
  for (auto it : llvm::enumerate(  
           llvm::zip(getRegionOperands().getTypes(),  
                     entryBlock.getArgumentTypes()))) {  
    mlir::Type operandType \= std::get(it.value());  
    mlir::Type argumentType \= std::get(it.value());  
    if (operandType\!= argumentType) {  
      return emitOpError("type mismatch for region operand ")  
             \<\< it.index() \<\< ": op has type '" \<\< operandType  
             \<\< "' but region expects type '" \<\< argumentType \<\< "'";  
    }  
  }

  // Check 3: Verify the terminator is an orchestra.yield.  
  Operation \*terminator \= entryBlock.getTerminator();  
  if (\!terminator) {  
    return emitOpError("block in region is not terminated");  
  }  
  auto yieldOp \= dyn\_cast\<orchestra::YieldOp\>(terminator);  
  if (\!yieldOp) {  
    return emitOpError("block in region must be terminated by an "  
                       "'orchestra.yield' op, but found '")  
           \<\< terminator-\>getName() \<\< "'";  
  }

  // Check 4: Verify the yield-to-result type mapping.  
  if (yieldOp.getOperands().size()\!= getNumResults()) {  
    return emitOpError("has an incorrect number of results (")  
           \<\< getNumResults()  
           \<\< ") that does not match the number of operands to the "  
           "'orchestra.yield' terminator ("  
           \<\< yieldOp.getOperands().size() \<\< ")";  
  }  
  for (auto it : llvm::enumerate(  
           llvm::zip(yieldOp.getOperands().getTypes(), getResultTypes()))) {  
    mlir::Type yieldOperandType \= std::get(it.value());  
    mlir::Type resultType \= std::get(it.value());  
    if (yieldOperandType\!= resultType) {  
      return emitOpError("type mismatch for result ")  
             \<\< it.index() \<\< ": 'orchestra.yield' provides type '"  
             \<\< yieldOperandType \<\< "' but op expects type '"

  return mlir::success();  
}

This implementation demonstrates best practices by checking each invariant separately and emitting a specific, contextual diagnostic for each potential failure mode, guiding the user directly to the source of the error.

## **Part 5: A Practical Field Guide to Testing and Debugging**

This final part provides actionable, procedural knowledge for ensuring verifiers are correct and for systematically diagnosing them when they fail. It synthesizes the real-world debugging scenarios from the source material into a reusable methodology for any MLIR developer.

### **5.1 Writing Bulletproof Verifier Tests**

A verifier is only as good as its tests. The MLIR testing guide emphasizes the use of lit tests combined with FileCheck to verify not only that errors are caught but also that the diagnostic messages are correct.1 This approach treats the compiler's diagnostic output as a core, testable feature of the developer experience.

#### **Verifying Diagnostics with expected-error and expected-note**

Negative test cases are essential for validating a verifier's error-reporting capabilities. MLIR's test infrastructure provides annotations that can be placed in .mlir test files to assert that specific diagnostics are emitted.14

* // expected-error@+N {{...}}: Asserts that an error diagnostic containing the specified message occurs N lines below the annotation. @-N checks N lines above, and @ checks the same line.  
* // expected-note@+N {{...}}: Similarly asserts that a note diagnostic is emitted.

By using these annotations, a test can rigorously validate the entire diagnostic structure, including the primary error and all attached notes. This creates a binding contract that prevents regressions in error reporting, ensuring that a helpful diagnostic does not accidentally get simplified or removed in a future refactoring.1

An example negative test case for a type mismatch:

MLIR

// RUN: mlir-opt %s \--split-input-file \--verify-diagnostics

func.func @test\_type\_mismatch(%cond: i1) {  
  %c0 \= arith.constant 0.0: f32  
  %c1 \= arith.constant 1 : i32  
  // expected-error@+1 {{'orchestra.commit' op requires compatible types for 'true' and 'false' value pairs; mismatch found at index 0}}  
  %0 \= orchestra.commit %cond, \[%c0\], \[%c1\] : (f32, i32) \-\> f32  
  // expected-note@-2 {{type 'f32' from the 'true' branch is not compatible with type 'i32' from the 'false' branch}}  
  // expected-note@-3 {{'true' branch value defined here}}  
  // expected-note@-4 {{'false' branch value defined here}}  
  return  
}

#### **The Critical Importance of \--split-input-file**

A common pitfall when writing verifier tests with multiple invalid cases in a single file is that the test runner, mlir-opt, will encounter the first error, report it, and exit with a failure code. Since the tool exits early, the expected-error directives for later test cases are never checked, causing the lit test to fail because not all expectations were met.1

The standard MLIR solution for this is to split the test file into multiple independent chunks that the runner can process separately. This is achieved by 1:

1. Adding the \--split-input-file flag to the RUN line of the test.  
2. Adding // \----- separators between each independent test case (e.g., between each func.func).

This ensures each case is tested independently, preventing a cascading failure where one error masks all the others.

### **5.2 A Forensic Toolkit for Debugging Verifier Failures**

Debugging verifiers requires peeling back layers of abstraction. A failing test is just a symptom; the root cause could be a string mismatch in FileCheck, a generic trait verifier preempting a custom one, a bug in the custom verifier's logic, or even a bug in the parser that feeds the verifier a malformed in-memory state. The following systematic process, synthesized from the provided debugging guides, helps to efficiently navigate these layers.1

#### **Hypothesis: Is it the Verifier or the Parser?**

When a verifier behaves unexpectedly, do not assume the verifier's logic is at fault. The problem may be further upstream in the parser, which constructs the in-memory Operation object that the verifier inspects. The crucial first step is to verify what the verifier is *actually seeing*. Classic llvm::errs() print statements added to the C++ verify() method can reveal the state of the operation's operands and attributes as seen by the verifier. A discrepancy between the .mlir source and the printed state definitively points to a parser issue.1

#### **Step 1: Reveal the True Diagnostic**

When a diagnostic test fails, the most common cause is a mismatch between the diagnostic that is produced and the diagnostic that is expected by the test harness.1 The first step is to uncover the actual diagnostic message being produced. This can be done by temporarily disabling the check in the test file 1:

1. Comment out or modify the // expected-error line for the failing case.  
2. Re-run the test.  
3. The test will still fail, but the lit output will now report an "unexpected diagnostic" and print the raw message that was actually emitted by the compiler.  
4. This exact string can then be used to correct the expected-error annotation in the test file.

#### **Step 2: Pinpoint the Source with Advanced Flags**

For deeper analysis, mlir-opt and other MLIR-based tools provide powerful command-line flags that offer greater insight into the verification process 1:

* **\-mlir-print-stacktrace-on-diagnostic**: This flag is invaluable for determining the origin of a diagnostic. When an error is emitted, MLIR will print the C++ stack trace leading to the emission call. This will definitively show whether the diagnostic is coming from a generic trait implementation within the MLIR framework, from an ODS-generated verifyInvariants method, or from a custom verify() method in your dialect's codebase.  
* **\-mlir-print-op-on-diagnostic**: When a diagnostic is attached to an operation, this flag causes MLIR to print the full textual form of that operation as a note alongside the diagnostic. This is extremely useful for confirming the exact state of the IR (operand counts, types, attributes) at the moment the verifier failed, eliminating any guesswork.

#### **Step 3: Inspect the Generated Code**

The ultimate source of truth for an operation's behavior is the C++ code generated by mlir-tblgen from its .td definition. Manually inspecting these generated files (e.g., MyDialectOps.h.inc, MyDialectOps.cpp.inc), which are typically located in the build directory, can clarify exactly what code is being executed. This allows one to confirm the presence of injected verifyTrait methods from traits or to examine the logic of the ODS-generated verifyInvariants method, clarifying their role in the final compiled binary.1

By applying this structured forensic toolkit, developers can systematically and efficiently diagnose even the most subtle verifier and diagnostic-related issues.

### **Conclusion**

The journey from a baseline verifier to a production-quality implementation involves a deliberate shift in focus from mere correctness to robust, extensible, and developer-friendly design. This guide has detailed a comprehensive blueprint for this process, grounded in the architectural principles of the MLIR framework.

The four key pillars of this advanced approach provide a roadmap for architects of MLIR dialects. First, strict adherence to the **principle of local verification** ensures that operations remain composable, modular components that do not obstruct the progressive lowering process. Global invariants must be delegated to dedicated analysis passes. Second, implementing **semantic type compatibility through interfaces** decouples an operation's verifier from the specifics of the dialect's type system, creating a flexible and extensible design that can evolve as the dialect grows. Third, crafting **precise and actionable diagnostics** with the InFlightDiagnostic API transforms the verifier into an invaluable tool for developers, drastically reducing debugging time. Finally, the deliberate and explicit **handling of variadic edge cases** clarifies an operation's semantic contract and simplifies the design of other compiler transformations.

By integrating these advanced techniques, an operation's verifier becomes more than a simple gatekeeper against malformed IR. It becomes an active enabler of compiler quality, a guarantor of architectural integrity, and a critical component of a productive and maintainable compiler ecosystem. This investment in verification is a hallmark of high-quality compiler engineering and is fundamental to the success of any large-scale project built on MLIR.
