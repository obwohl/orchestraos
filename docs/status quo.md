The repository is currently at commit `6459be0` ("feat: Define the OrchestraPasses C++ library").

**Description of the repository at this point:**

The repository contains the foundational elements for an MLIR-based compiler for the "Orchestra" domain. It includes:
*   **Orchestra Dialect Definition:** Located in `orchestra-compiler/include/Orchestra/`, this defines the custom operations and types for the Orchestra dialect using MLIR's TableGen (`.td`) files.
*   **Orchestra Dialect Implementation:** In `orchestra-compiler/lib/Orchestra/`, the C++ implementation of the Orchestra dialect is provided.
*   **Orchestra Passes Library:** In `orchestra-compiler/lib/OrchestraPasses/`, a C++ library is defined to house MLIR passes specific to the Orchestra dialect. At this commit, it specifically includes `DivergenceToSpeculation.cpp`, which is intended to be an MLIR pass.
*   **Orchestra Optimizer Tool (`orchestra-opt`):** In `orchestra-compiler/tools/orchestra-opt/`, a basic command-line tool is set up. This tool is intended to load the Orchestra dialect and apply optimizations (passes) to MLIR code written in this dialect.

**What it factually does:**

*   **Builds Cleanly:** The project successfully compiles and links, producing the `orchestra-opt` executable and the necessary libraries (`libOrchestra.a`, `libOrchestraPasses.a`).
*   **Defines Dialect and Operations:** It sets up the structure for the Orchestra dialect and its operations.
*   **Defines an MLIR Pass:** It includes the definition of the `DivergenceToSpeculation` pass.
*   **Tool Execution:** The `orchestra-opt` tool can be executed.

**However, it's important to note:**

Despite building cleanly, when attempting to parse `test.mlir` (which contains the `orchestra.yield` operation), the `orchestra-opt` tool *factually* reports an "unknown op" error. This indicates that while the framework for the dialect and tool is present, the specific `orchestra.yield` operation is not being recognized or correctly registered by the tool at this stage. Therefore, while the project builds, it does not yet fully process MLIR code containing `orchestra.yield` operations.
