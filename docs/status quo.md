The repository is currently at a state after the commit `6459be0`.

**Description of the repository at this point:**

The repository contains the foundational elements for an MLIR-based compiler for the "Orchestra" domain. The CMake build system has been refactored to follow the canonical MLIR structure, separating the dialect's interface and implementation. It includes:
*   **Orchestra Dialect Definition:** Located in `orchestra-compiler/include/Orchestra/`, this defines the custom operations and types for the Orchestra dialect using MLIR's TableGen (`.td`) files.
*   **Orchestra Dialect Implementation:** In `orchestra-compiler/lib/Orchestra/`, the C++ implementation of the Orchestra dialect is provided.
*   **Orchestra Passes Library:** In `orchechestra-compiler/lib/OrchestraPasses/`, a C++ library is defined to house MLIR passes specific to the Orchestra dialect.

**What it factually does:**

*   **Builds Cleanly:** The project successfully compiles and links, producing the dialect and passes libraries (`libOrchestra.a`, `libOrchestraPasses.a`).

**What is missing:**

*   There is no main executable tool (like `orchestra-opt`) to parse MLIR files and run passes.
*   The testing infrastructure is not set up.
