# Project Status: Active and Stable

**Last Updated:** 2025-08-16

## 1. Current State

The Orchestra compiler is in a **stable, buildable, and verifiable state**. The core infrastructure, including the custom `Orchestra` dialect and the `orchestra-opt` tool, compiles successfully against LLVM 20.

The project has a functional test suite built with the LLVM Integrated Tester (`lit`), which can be executed via the `tests/run.py` script. All existing tests are passing, confirming that the basic dialect and operations are correctly registered and processed.

Key characteristics of the current project state:
- **Build System:** CMake-based, aligned with standard MLIR practices.
- **Dependencies:** LLVM/MLIR 20.
- **Core Tool:** `orchestra-opt` is functional.
- **Testing:** A `lit` test suite is in place and passing.

## 2. Recent History: Formalizing the OrchestraIR Dialect

The `OrchestraIR` dialect has been formally implemented as specified in Section 1 of the
[MLIR Implementation Plan](../architecture/mlir-implementation-plan.md).
This work included:
- Defining the `schedule`, `task`, `transfer`, `commit`, and `yield` operations in TableGen.
- Implementing C++ verifiers for the `commit` and `transfer` operations to ensure their semantic correctness.
- Correcting several issues in the initial TableGen definitions that were causing build failures.
- Adding a new test case to verify that the core dialect operations are registered and parsable.

This foundational work stabilizes the core dialect, allowing for the implementation of higher-level passes.

### Previously: Resolving the "Unregistered Operation" Blocker

The project was recently unblocked from a critical runtime issue where the `orchestra-opt` tool would fail with an "unregistered operation" error. This was a complex problem rooted in a combination of:
1.  **Fragile Dialect Registration:** The initial static registration of the dialect was prone to being optimized away by the linker. This was fixed by moving to an explicit registration call in `main`.
2.  **Inconsistent Namespacing:** The C++ namespace was inconsistent between TableGen files, CMake scripts, and C++ sources. This was resolved by standardizing on the `orchestra` namespace.
3.  **Incorrect TableGen Includes:** The most subtle issue was an incorrect include structure in `OrchestraDialect.cpp`, which prevented the dialect's operations from being registered correctly.

A detailed post-mortem of this issue has been archived for historical reference. The resolution of this blocker has made the project stable and ready for further development.

## 3. Next Steps and Future Work

With the foundational infrastructure now stable, development can proceed based on the project's architectural blueprint. The next phases of development should focus on implementing the features outlined in the implementation plan.

- **Implementation Plan:** For a detailed guide on the planned features, including new passes and dialect extensions, please refer to the **[MLIR Implementation Plan](../architecture/mlir-implementation-plan.md)**.

This plan provides the roadmap for future contributions and serves as the primary reference for architectural decisions.
