# Current Build Status and Troubleshooting Guide

Last updated: 2025-08-11

## 1. Overview

This document provides a summary of the current build status of the `orchestra-compiler` project and a guide for troubleshooting the issues that have been encountered.

**The project is currently unbuildable.** The build now fails with persistent C++ compilation errors related to MLIR 18.1's internal types and TableGen-generated code, despite correct project structure and CMake configuration.

This guide will walk through the debugging process that has been performed so far and provide a clear path to resolving the remaining build issues.

## 2. Project Structure and CMake Configuration

The fundamental issue of incorrect project structure and CMake configuration has been resolved. The project now adheres to the canonical MLIR out-of-tree project structure, as detailed in `cmake-build-guide.md`.

## 3. Debugging Log and Resolved Issues

The following is a log of the issues that have been encountered and resolved so far.

### 3.1. TableGen Syntax Errors

The initial build failed due to syntax errors in `include/Orchestra/OrchestraOps.td`. These were corrected.

### 3.2. Missing `BytecodeOpInterface` Header

After fixing the TableGen errors, the build failed with errors indicating that `mlir::BytecodeOpInterface` was not defined. This was resolved by adding `#include "mlir/Bytecode/BytecodeOpInterface.h"` to `lib/Orchestra/OrchestraDialect.cpp`.

### 3.3. Structural and CMake-related "Type Not Found" Errors

Previous errors related to incorrect project structure and CMake configuration, such as `‘CommitOpGenericAdaptorBase’ does not name a type` and issues with `GET_OP_LIST` scope, have been resolved by restructuring the project and updating CMake files to follow canonical MLIR practices.

### 3.4. Persistent MLIR 18.1 Compilation Errors

Despite resolving structural and CMake issues, the build now consistently fails with specific C++ compilation errors related to MLIR 18.1. These include:
*   **Incomplete type `mlir::EmptyProperties`**: This error occurs even when `usePropertiesForAttributes = 0` is explicitly set in the TableGen dialect definition, suggesting a deeper issue with how MLIR 18.1's TableGen-generated code interacts with the C++ compiler regarding properties.
*   **`expected template-name before ‘<’ token` for `mlir::Op`**: This indicates a problem with the `mlir::Op` template instantiation, possibly due to an underlying issue with type definitions or how MLIR's core components are being resolved.

## 4. Path to Resolution

The project's structure and CMake configuration now align with canonical MLIR practices. The path to fixing the build now involves investigating and resolving the persistent MLIR 18.1 specific compilation errors.

## 5. Current Blocking Issues

The project is currently blocked on the following issues:

*   **MLIR 18.1 `mlir::EmptyProperties` incomplete type error**: This prevents successful compilation of the dialect's C++ implementation.
*   **MLIR 18.1 `mlir::Op` template instantiation errors**: These errors indicate a fundamental problem with how operations are being defined or recognized by the compiler in this MLIR version.

## 6. Next Steps

The next steps are to investigate the specific MLIR 18.1 compilation errors. This may involve:

1.  Consulting MLIR 18.1 release notes and documentation for known issues or specific requirements related to properties and operation definitions.
2.  Searching MLIR community forums or bug trackers for similar issues.
3.  Attempting to find a known working example of an out-of-tree MLIR dialect that successfully compiles with MLIR 18.1 to compare configurations and code.
4.  Potentially simplifying the dialect's `.td` file further or experimenting with different MLIR core includes to isolate the exact cause of the `EmptyProperties` and `mlir::Op` template errors.
