# Architectural Decision Records (ADRs)

This directory contains the Architectural Decision Records (ADRs) for the OrchestraOS compiler project. An ADR is a short document that captures a significant architectural decision, along with its context and consequences.

## Purpose

The purpose of maintaining ADRs is to create a historical log of key design choices. This helps new team members understand the "why" behind the current architecture and prevents the re-litigation of past decisions.

## When to Write an ADR

An ADR should be created for any decision that has a significant impact on the architecture, such as:

*   Choosing a new library or framework.
*   Defining a major new interface between components.
*   Selecting a specific approach to a cross-cutting concern (e.g., error handling, logging).
*   Deciding to deprecate a major feature.

## ADR Template

When creating a new ADR, please use the following template. The filename should be of the form `ADR-XXX-brief-description.md`, where `XXX` is a sequential number.

```markdown
# ADR-XXX: [Title of ADR]

*   **Status:** [Proposed | Accepted | Superseded by ADR-YYY | Deprecated]
*   **Date:** [YYYY-MM-DD]

## Context

[Describe the problem or situation that this ADR addresses. What is the issue that needs to be solved? What are the constraints and requirements?]

## Decision

[Describe the chosen solution. What is the change that we are making?]

## Alternatives Considered

[Describe other options that were considered and explain why they were rejected. This is a crucial section, as it shows that the decision was not made in a vacuum.]

## Consequences

[Describe the positive and negative consequences of this decision. What are the trade-offs? How will this decision impact the codebase, the development process, and the team?]
