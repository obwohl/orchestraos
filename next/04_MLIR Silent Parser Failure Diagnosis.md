# **Analysis and Resolution of a Silent Parser Failure for Custom MLIR Operations with Variadic Operands**

## **I. Deconstructing the Silent Parser Failure: A Race Condition in Declarative Parsing**

The silent failure observed in the orchestra.commit operation verifier test is not the result of a bug in the C++ verifier logic or a simple framework issue. Instead, it stems from a fundamental limitation and ambiguity within MLIR's declarative assembly format system when tasked with parsing operations that have complex, multi-segment variadic operand structures. The issue can be understood as a "race condition" between the bespoke parsing logic generated from the assemblyFormat string and the monolithic sub-parser invoked by the functional-type directive.

### **The Declarative Parser's Eager and Sequential Nature**

MLIR's Operation Definition Specification (ODS) provides a powerful declarative system for defining operations, including their textual representation, through the assemblyFormat field.1 When this field is used,

mlir-tblgen generates a predictive C++ parser that attempts to match the input text token-by-token against the specified format. This generated parser is highly efficient for operations with a linear, unambiguous structure.

Directives within the assemblyFormat string, such as $condition, $true\_values, attr-dict, and functional-type, are not merely placeholders. They are hooks that invoke specialized sub-parsers for common IR elements.3 The

functional-type directive, in particular, is designed to parse the complete function-like signature of an operation, such as (i1, f32, f32, f32) \-\> f32, and is a critical component of MLIR's generic operation representation.4

### **The functional-type Ambiguity with Structured Variadic Operands**

The root of the silent failure lies in the conflict between the structured operand grouping defined in the assemblyFormat and the flat, unstructured view of operands assumed by the functional-type sub-parser.

The assemblyFormat for orchestra.commit is:  
"$condition true ($true\_values) false ($false\_values)attr-dict: functional-type(operands, results)"  
This format clearly delineates three distinct operand groups: a single $condition, a variadic list $true\_values, and a second variadic list $false\_values. The parser generated for this part of the format string correctly uses the keywords true and false and the parentheses to parse the SSA value names into these logical groups.

However, the functional-type sub-parser operates independently of this custom grouping. When it encounters the type signature (i1, f32, f32, f32) \-\> f32, its internal logic expects to have parsed a simple, flat list of four SSA value operands that correspond one-to-one with the input types. It has no mechanism to understand that these four operands are meant to be partitioned into the $condition, $true\_values, and $false\_values segments.

When parsing the invalid IR, the following sequence occurs:

1. The top-level parser successfully consumes %cond, the true keyword, (, %t1, and ). It has now parsed one operand for the $true\_values segment.  
2. It then consumes the false keyword, (, %f1, ,, %f2, and ). It has now parsed two operands for the $false\_values segment.  
3. The parser then encounters the colon and invokes the functional-type sub-parser.  
4. This sub-parser sees a type list (i1, f32, f32, f32) which implies a total of four operands. The custom parser has also identified four operand uses (%cond, %t1, %f1, %f2). However, the crucial step of matching the parsed SSA values to the ODS-defined operand names (condition, true\_values, false\_values) fails. The functional-type parser's logic cannot reconcile the structured parsing results with the flat list of types it is given.  
5. This mismatch is a fundamental structural inconsistency. The sub-parser determines that the rule does not match and returns a generic failure(). This failure propagates up, causing the entire parsing attempt for the orchestra.commit operation to fail.

Crucially, this failure happens at a very low level of syntactic matching, before enough semantic context has been established to formulate a meaningful diagnostic message. The parser simply concludes "this text does not conform to the expected grammar" and exits silently.

### **The True Role of the SameVariadicOperandSize Trait**

A key point of investigation is the SameVariadicOperandSize trait. The documentation states that for operations with multiple variadic operands, either this trait or AttrSizedOperandSegments is required to disambiguate the operand segments.5 This might suggest the trait should participate in parsing or verification. However, its role is strictly post-construction.

The SameVariadicOperandSize trait serves two primary purposes:

1. **Guiding C++ Accessor Generation:** It provides a hint to mlir-tblgen on how to generate the C++ getter methods for the variadic operands (e.g., getTrue\_values() and getFalse\_values()). The generated code for these accessors relies on a simple algebraic formula to calculate the size of each variadic segment, assuming they are all equal. This logic is visible in the MLIR source code that generates these methods.6 The formula is essentially  
   variadicSize \= (totalOperands \- numNonVariadicOperands) / numVariadicOperands. This calculation can only be performed on a fully constructed Operation object that has a final, known number of operands.  
2. **Informing the ODS-Generated Verifier:** The trait injects a verification rule into the verifyInvariants method, which is automatically generated for the operation. This rule performs the same size calculation and checks that the remainder is zero, ensuring all variadic segments are indeed the same length. This verification, however, is part of the post-construction verification sequence.3

The silent failure prevents an Operation object from ever being constructed. Consequently, neither the C++ accessors nor the verifyInvariants method are ever called, and the logic contributed by SameVariadicOperandSize is never executed. The trait is not, and was never intended to be, a parse-time constraint checker.

## **II. The MLIR Operation Lifecycle: From Raw Text to Verified Instance**

To fully grasp why the verifier test fails, it is essential to understand the distinct stages an MLIR operation undergoes from its textual form in a .mlir file to a verified in-memory object. The silent failure is a direct consequence of the process halting at the very first stage, preventing the subsequent stages—where verification occurs—from ever being reached.

### **Stage 1: Lexing and Parsing (The Point of Failure)**

The lifecycle begins when a tool like orchestra-opt feeds the .mlir source file to the MLIR parser.8 The parser's goal is to transform the textual representation into a valid in-memory

Operation instance.

* **Action:** The parser reads the string orchestra.commit %cond true(%t1) false(%f1, %f2) :....  
* **Process:** It attempts to match this string against the grammar generated from the Orchestra\_CommitOp's assemblyFormat.  
* **Outcome (Failure):** As detailed in the previous section, the inherent conflict between the structured operand syntax and the flat functional-type directive leads to an unresolvable ambiguity. The generated parser returns mlir::failure() without creating an OperationState object and, critically, without emitting a diagnostic.  
* **Result:** The process for this specific operation aborts immediately. The parser may then continue to the next operation in the file, but the invalid orchestra.commit is effectively discarded.

### **Stage 2: Operation Construction (Never Reached)**

This stage is contingent on a successful parse. If the parser had returned mlir::success(), it would have populated an mlir::OperationState object with all the necessary components: resolved SSA operand Values, attributes, result types, and source location information.4 The MLIR framework would then use this

OperationState to construct the final, in-memory mlir::Operation object. For the invalid IR in question, this stage is never initiated.

### **Stage 3: Post-Construction Verification (The Unreached Checks)**

Once an Operation object is successfully constructed, the framework subjects it to a rigorous, multi-step verification process to ensure its semantic validity.3 This is the stage where the

expected-error in the test case is designed to be caught. The verification sequence is strictly ordered:

1. **Structural Trait Verification:** Initial checks from structural traits are performed.  
2. **verifyInvariants (ODS-Generated):** This is the first major verification step. The method, automatically generated by TableGen, checks all constraints defined in the .td file. This is where the SameVariadicOperandSize trait's check would execute, and it would indeed fail for the given operand counts (1 vs. 2). If this check were reached, it would emit an error.  
3. **Other Trait Verifiers (verifyTrait):** Verifiers implemented by other attached traits would run.  
4. **Custom C++ Verifier (hasVerifier=1):** Finally, the developer-provided verify() method is called. The expected-error message in verify-commit.mlir ('orchestra.commit' op has mismatched variadic operand sizes) was intended to be emitted from this custom verifier.

Because the process fails at Stage 1, the entire verification stack of Stage 3 is bypassed. The C++ verifier is never called, and no diagnostic is ever emitted.

The core of the problem is a mismatch in expectations. The test case is written to detect a *semantic* error (mismatched operand counts), which is the responsibility of the verifier. However, the specific textual representation of this invalidity creates a *syntactic* error that the declarative parser cannot handle. The framework's "front door"—the parser—rejects the input before it can be handed off to the "inspector"—the verifier. The solution, therefore, requires moving the validation logic from the post-construction verifier into a more powerful, custom parsing routine that can handle the ambiguous syntax and emit a diagnostic at the correct time.

## **III. The Solution: Implementing a Robust Custom Parser for orchestra.commit**

The definitive solution to the silent parser failure is to abandon the declarative assemblyFormat in favor of a custom C++ parser. This approach provides complete control over the parsing process, allowing for the implementation of precise logic to handle the multiple variadic operand segments and to emit detailed, correctly-located diagnostics when the input is malformed.

### **Transitioning to a Custom Parser**

The first step is to modify the operation's definition in OrchestraOps.td. The assemblyFormat line must be removed and replaced with let hasCustomAssemblyFormat \= 1;. This signals to mlir-tblgen to not generate parser and printer implementations, but instead to generate forward declarations for parse and print methods that must be implemented manually in C++.1

**Modified OrchestraOps.td:**

Code-Snippet

def Orchestra\_CommitOp : Orchestra\_Op\<"commit",\> {  
  let summary \= "Selects one of two SSA values based on a boolean condition.";  
  let arguments \= (ins  
    I1:$condition,  
    Variadic\<AnyType\>:$true\_values,  
    Variadic\<AnyType\>:$false\_values  
  );  
  let results \= (outs Variadic\<AnyType\>:$results);

  let hasVerifier \= 1;  
  let hasCanonicalizer \= 1;

  // Replace assemblyFormat with hasCustomAssemblyFormat  
  let hasCustomAssemblyFormat \= 1;  
}

### **Implementing the Custom parse Method**

With the TableGen definition updated, the next step is to provide the C++ implementation for the parse method in the appropriate dialect source file (e.g., OrchestraOps.cpp). This method is responsible for consuming tokens from the input stream, validating the syntax, and populating the OperationState object.

The following is a complete, commented implementation that correctly handles the orchestra.commit syntax and provides robust error reporting.

C++

\#**include** "mlir/IR/OpImplementation.h"

//... other necessary includes

// The parse method is a static member of the CommitOp class.  
ParseResult CommitOp::parse(OpAsmParser \&parser, OperationState \&result) {  
  // 1\. Parse the condition operand.  
  OpAsmParser::UnresolvedOperand condOperand;  
  if (parser.parseOperand(condOperand)) {  
    return failure();  
  }

  // 2\. Parse the 'true' branch operands.  
  SmallVector\<OpAsmParser::UnresolvedOperand\> trueOperands;  
  if (parser.parseKeyword("true") |

| parser.parseLParen() ||  
      parser.parseOperandList(trueOperands) |

| parser.parseRParen()) {  
    return failure();  
  }

  // 3\. Parse the 'false' branch operands.  
  SmallVector\<OpAsmParser::UnresolvedOperand\> falseOperands;  
  if (parser.parseKeyword("false") |

| parser.parseLParen() ||  
      parser.parseOperandList(falseOperands) |

| parser.parseRParen()) {  
    return failure();  
  }

  // 4\. The Critical Check: Manually verify the variadic operand counts.  
  // This is where the silent failure is fixed. We now have explicit control  
  // to check invariants at parse time.  
  if (trueOperands.size()\!= falseOperands.size()) {  
    return parser.emitError(parser.getNameLoc(),  
                            "'orchestra.commit' op has mismatched variadic "  
                            "operand sizes: 'true' branch has ")  
           \<\< trueOperands.size() \<\< " operands, but 'false' branch has "  
           \<\< falseOperands.size() \<\< " operands.";  
  }

  // 5\. Parse the attribute dictionary.  
  if (parser.parseOptionalAttrDict(result.attributes)) {  
    return failure();  
  }

  // 6\. Parse the trailing functional type.  
  FunctionType funcType;  
  if (parser.parseColon() |

| parser.parseType(funcType)) {  
    return failure();  
  }  
  result.addTypes(funcType.getResults());

  // 7\. Resolve operands and validate against the functional type.  
  // The functional type's inputs must match the total number of parsed operands.  
  if (funcType.getNumInputs()\!= 1 \+ trueOperands.size() \+ falseOperands.size()) {  
    return parser.emitError(parser.getNameLoc(),  
                            "functional type does not match number of operands");  
  }

  // Resolve the condition operand.  
  if (parser.resolveOperand(condOperand, funcType.getInput(0), result.operands)) {  
    return failure();  
  }

  // Resolve the true\_values operands.  
  TypeRange trueTypes \= funcType.getInputs().drop\_front(1).take\_front(trueOperands.size());  
  if (parser.resolveOperands(trueOperands, trueTypes, result.operands)) {  
    return failure();  
  }

  // Resolve the false\_values operands.  
  TypeRange falseTypes \= funcType.getInputs().drop\_front(1 \+ trueOperands.size());  
  if (parser.resolveOperands(falseOperands, falseTypes, result.operands)) {  
    return failure();  
  }  
    
  return success();  
}

This implementation uses the OpAsmParser API 10 to consume tokens and operands. The key improvement is step 4, where an explicit check on the sizes of the parsed operand lists is performed. If the sizes mismatch,

parser.emitError() is called.10 This creates a diagnostic at the operation's location (

parser.getNameLoc()) with a detailed message, which will be caught by the \--verify-diagnostics test harness, allowing the test to pass.

### **Implementing the Custom print Method**

To ensure that the operation can be correctly printed back to its textual form (round-tripping), a corresponding print method must also be implemented.

C++

void CommitOp::print(OpAsmPrinter \&p) {  
  p \<\< " " \<\< getCondition();  
    
  p \<\< " true(";  
  p.printOperands(getTrueValues());  
  p \<\< ")";

  p \<\< " false(";  
  p.printOperands(getFalseValues());  
  p \<\< ")";

  p.printOptionalAttrDict((\*this)-\>getAttrs());  
  p \<\< " : " \<\< getOperation()-\>getFunctionType();  
}

### **Declarative vs. Custom Assembly Formats: A Design Guide**

The experience with orchestra.commit provides a valuable lesson in MLIR dialect design. The choice between a declarative assemblyFormat and a custom C++ parser is a critical architectural decision with significant trade-offs. The following table serves as a guide for making this decision in future operation development.

| Feature | Declarative (assemblyFormat) | Custom (hasCustomAssemblyFormat) |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Ease of Use** | High. Excellent for rapid prototyping and for operations with simple, linear operand and attribute structures. | Higher initial effort. Requires manual implementation of C++ parsing and printing logic. |
| **Expressiveness** | Limited. Struggles with non-linear, nested, or ambiguous syntactic structures, particularly with multiple variadic segments. | Unrestricted. Can be written to parse any custom syntax, providing maximum flexibility for domain-specific notations. |
| **Error Reporting** | Opaque and often brittle. Relies on generated logic that can fail silently or produce generic "failed to parse" errors. | Full, explicit control. Allows for precise, context-aware diagnostic messages emitted at the exact point of failure. |
| **Complex Operands** | Unsuitable for multiple variadic operands when combined with directives like functional-type, as demonstrated by this issue. | Robust and reliable. The imperative C++ logic can explicitly handle the partitioning and validation of complex operand structures. |
| **Maintainability** | The .td syntax is concise, but debugging the behavior of the generated C++ code is difficult and non-intuitive. | The C++ code is more verbose, but the parsing and printing logic is explicit, self-documenting, and easily debuggable. |

**Recommendation:** Use the declarative assemblyFormat for the majority of operations that have a straightforward structure. For any operation with multiple variadic operands, optional operand groups, or a highly customized, non-linear syntax, invest the upfront effort to implement a custom parser using hasCustomAssemblyFormat. This will lead to a more robust, maintainable, and user-friendly dialect.

## **IV. Advanced Strategies for Debugging the MLIR Parser**

Diagnosing low-level parsing and verification issues in MLIR requires a systematic approach and familiarity with the framework's debugging tools. The silent failure of orchestra.commit serves as an excellent case study for developing these skills.

### **Command-Line Forensics: Your First Line of Defense**

mlir-opt provides a suite of command-line flags designed to provide deep insight into the compilation process. For parser-level issues, the following are indispensable.13

* **\-mlir-print-stacktrace-on-diagnostic**: This is the most critical flag for investigating potential silent failures. It forces MLIR to print a full C++ stack trace whenever any diagnostic (error, warning, or note) is emitted.11 If a diagnostic were being emitted but suppressed by the test harness or another part of the system, this flag would reveal its origin. Running  
  orchestra-opt \--verify-diagnostics \-mlir-print-stacktrace-on-diagnostic verify-commit.mlir and seeing no output would have confirmed that no diagnostic was being emitted at all, strongly pointing to a pre-diagnostic failure in the parser.  
* **\-mlir-print-op-generic**: This flag instructs the printer to use the generic assembly format (e.g., "orchestra.commit"(%cond, %t1, %f1, %f2)) instead of the custom one. While less useful for a pre-construction parsing failure, it is invaluable for debugging issues where an operation is successfully parsed but is structurally incorrect (e.g., a buggy pass adds an extra operand). The generic form is an isomorphic representation of the in-memory Operation object and will always reveal its true structure.13  
* **\--mlir-print-ir-after-failure**: When a verifier fails, this flag dumps the entire IR of the module. This provides crucial context around the failing operation, which can help identify the pass that introduced the invalid IR.13  
* **\--verify-each=0**: This flag disables the verifier entirely. Its primary use in debugging is to allow the printing of IR that is so malformed it causes the verifier itself to crash. This is a last-resort tool to get a textual snapshot of an invalid state.13

### **Source-Level Debugging with GDB/LLDB: The Ultimate Tool**

For truly opaque failures within generated code, the only way to gain full visibility is to step through the execution with a source-level debugger like GDB or LLDB. This provides an uncompromised view into the parser's internal state.

The workflow to debug the orchestra.commit silent failure would be:

1. **Locate the Generated Code:** After building the project, mlir-tblgen places the generated C++ code for operations in the build directory. The file would typically be located at a path like build/tools/orchestra-compiler/dialect/OrchestraOps.cpp.inc.  
2. **Identify the Target Function:** Inside this file, there will be a generated parse function for the dialect, which contains a case statement for each operation. The relevant function to set a breakpoint on would be the one called for parsing orchestra.commit. With a declarative format, this might be a complex template instantiation. With a custom parser, it's simply the CommitOp::parse method.  
3. **Set a Breakpoint:** Start orchestra-opt under GDB:  
   Bash  
   gdb \--args build/bin/orchestra-opt tests/verify-commit.mlir \--verify-diagnostics

   Then, set a breakpoint on the parsing function:  
   Code-Snippet  
   (gdb) b mlir::Orchestra::CommitOp::parse(mlir::OpAsmParser&, mlir::OperationState&)  
   (gdb) run

4. **Step and Inspect:** Once the breakpoint is hit, one can step through the parsing logic line by line. This would allow direct observation of the call to the functional-type sub-parser and its mlir::failure() return value, immediately revealing the precise location and cause of the silent exit.

### **Targeted Logging with LLVM\_DEBUG**

As a less intrusive alternative to a full debugger session, LLVM's LLVM\_DEBUG macro provides a powerful mechanism for targeted logging. This is particularly useful for tracing the execution path within the compiler's source code.13

To debug a parser issue, one could temporarily modify the MLIR source code itself (e.g., in mlir/lib/AsmParser/Parser.cpp) to add debug prints:

C++

// In a relevant parsing function in Parser.cpp  
\#**define** DEBUG\_TYPE "mlir-parser"  
//...  
LLVM\_DEBUG(llvm::dbgs() \<\< "Attempting to parse functional type...\\n");  
ParseResult res \= parseFunctionalType(...);  
LLVM\_DEBUG(llvm::dbgs() \<\< "Functional type parsing result: " \<\< (succeeded(res)? "success" : "failure") \<\< "\\n");

After rebuilding, running orchestra-opt with the \-debug-only=mlir-parser flag would enable only these specific print statements, producing a clean, targeted log of the parser's internal decisions without the overhead of a full debug session. This same technique is highly effective within custom C++ parsers for tracing their logic during development.

## **V. Final Recommendations and Complete Implementation**

The analysis has conclusively identified the root cause of the silent parser failure as a syntactic ambiguity between the declarative assemblyFormat and the functional-type directive when handling multiple variadic operands. The idiomatic and robust solution is to implement a custom C++ parser for the orchestra.commit operation. This approach provides the necessary control to correctly parse the complex syntax and emit precise diagnostics for invalid IR.

### **Summary of Findings**

* **Root Cause:** The declarative parser generator cannot reconcile the structured operand groups ($true\_values, $false\_values) with the flat operand list expected by the functional-type sub-parser, resulting in a silent syntactic parse failure.  
* **SameVariadicOperandSize Trait:** This trait operates post-construction, providing C++ accessor logic and a rule for the ODS verifier (verifyInvariants). It does not participate in parsing and is never invoked because the silent failure prevents operation construction.  
* **The Solution:** Migrating from a declarative assemblyFormat to a custom C++ parser (hasCustomAssemblyFormat \= 1\) is the correct resolution. A custom parser can explicitly handle the operand grouping and emit a detailed error message at parse time if the variadic segment sizes mismatch.

By integrating the following code, the verify-commit.mlir test will pass, as the parser will now emit the expected error message, unblocking further development of the OrchestraOS compiler.

### **Final OrchestraOps.td**

Code-Snippet

def Orchestra\_CommitOp : Orchestra\_Op\<"commit",\> {  
  let summary \= "Selects one of two SSA values based on a boolean condition.";  
  let description \=;

  let arguments \= (ins  
    I1:$condition,  
    Variadic\<AnyType\>:$true\_values,  
    Variadic\<AnyType\>:$false\_values  
  );  
  let results \= (outs Variadic\<AnyType\>:$results);

  let hasVerifier \= 1;  
  let hasCanonicalizer \= 1;

  let hasCustomAssemblyFormat \= 1;  
}

### **Final C++ Implementation**
