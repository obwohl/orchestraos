Here's the blueprint for the minimal setup of the OrchestraOS MLIR Compiler, as requested:

# OrchestraOS MLIR Compiler: Smallest Sensible Success (Compilation Blueprint)

This document provides a concrete, step-by-step guide to setting up the basic MLIR dialect development environment and successfully compiling the OrchestraIR dialect with a minimal operation. The goal is to validate the TableGen generation and C++ compilation process for a custom dialect, establishing the foundation for all subsequent OrchestraOS compiler development.

The OrchestraIR dialect is the core proprietary technology of the OrchestraOS compiler, explicitly materializing the decisions of a high-level, topology-aware scheduling pass into the Intermediate Representation (IR). MLIR dialects are defined declaratively using TableGen (`.td` files), which `mlir-tblgen` then uses to generate C++ classes and helper functions. This generated code, along with custom C++ implementation (e.g., for dialect initialization or verifiers), is then compiled, typically managed by CMake.

As prerequisites you have to install LLVM (and thus `mlir-tblgen`) (e.g., via Homebrew), providing the necessary MLIR tools.

## Mini-Step Guide: Compiling the OrchestraIR Dialect

### 1. Create Basic Project Structure

Begin by creating the necessary directory structure and empty files for your OrchestraOS compiler project:

```
orchestra-compiler/
├── CMakeLists.txt
├── include/
│   └── Orchestra/
│       └── OrchestraDialect.h
└── lib/
    └── Orchestra/
        ├── CMakeLists.txt
        ├── OrchestraDialect.cpp
        └── OrchestraOps.td
```

### 2. Define `lib/Orchestra/OrchestraOps.td`

This TableGen file defines the `OrchestraIR` dialect itself and your first, simplest operation: `orchestra.yield`. `orchestra.yield` is an ideal starting point as it is a standard terminator for regions and does not require complex arguments or traits beyond basic termination behavior.

```tablegen
// In lib/Orchestra/OrchestraOps.td

#ifndef ORCHESTRA_ORCHESTRAOPS_TD
#define ORCHESTRA_ORCHESTRAOPS_TD

include "mlir/IR/OpBase.td" // Base definitions for operations
include "mlir/IR/BuiltinAttributeInterfaces.td"
include "mlir/IR/BuiltinTypeInterfaces.td"
include "mlir/Interfaces/CallInterfaces.td"
include "mlir/Interfaces/ControlFlowInterfaces.td"
include "mlir/Interfaces/SideEffectInterfaces.td" // Required for Terminator and NoSideEffect traits

// Defines the Orchestra dialect.
def Orchestra_Dialect : Dialect {
  let name = "orchestra";
  let cppNamespace = "::orchestra";
  let summary = "The OrchestraOS proprietary compiler dialect.";
  let description = [{
    The OrchestraIR dialect is the heart of the OrchestraOS compiler's proprietary technology.
    It explicitly materializes the decisions of a high-level, topology-aware scheduling pass directly into the IR.
  }];
  let useDefaultDialectLoad = 1; // Simplifies initialization
  let has = 1; // The dialect has operations
  let hasType = 1; // The dialect can have custom types (even if none are defined yet)
  let hasAttr = 1; // The dialect can have attributes
  let hasRegion = 1; // The dialect uses regions
}

// Base class for all OrchestraIR operations.
class Orchestra_Op<string name, list<Trait> traits = []> :
    Op<Orchestra_Dialect, name, traits>;

// Defines the orchestra.yield operation.
def Orchestra_YieldOp : Orchestra_Op<"yield", [Terminator, NoSideEffect]> {
  let summary = "Terminator for regions in OrchestraIR operations.";
  let description = [{
    A terminator operation for regions within `orchestra.schedule` and
    `orchestra.task`. It yields values from the region to the parent op.
  }];
  let arguments = (ins Variadic<AnyType>:$operands); // Accepts any number of values
  let results = (outs ); // Yield operations typically do not have results
}

#endif // ORCHESTRA_ORCHESTRAOPS_TD
```

### 3. Create `lib/Orchestra/OrchestraDialect.cpp`

This C++ file registers your dialect with MLIR and includes and initializes the operation classes generated by TableGen.

```cpp
// In lib/Orchestra/OrchestraDialect.cpp

#include "Orchestra/OrchestraDialect.h" // Dialect declaration
#include "Orchestra/OrchestraOps.h.inc" // Generated operations

#include "mlir/IR/Builders.h"
#include "mlir/IR/BuiltinTypes.h"
#include "mlir/IR/DialectImplementation.h" // For MLIR Dialect initialization boilerplate

using namespace mlir;
using namespace orchestra;

//===----------------------------------------------------------------------===//
// Orchestra Dialect
//===----------------------------------------------------------------------===//

void OrchestraDialect::initialize() {
  // Registers all operations defined in OrchestraOps.td and
  // whose C++ implementations were generated by TableGen.
  addOperations<
#define GET_OP_LIST
#include "Orchestra/OrchestraOps.cpp.inc"
  >();
  // Custom types or attributes would be registered here:
  // addTypes<...>();
  // addAttributes<...>();
}

// Implementations for parsing and printing custom types and attributes.
// For this minimal step, these can remain empty or throw an error,
// as we are not defining custom types/attributes beyond the base ones.
mlir::Type OrchestraDialect::parseType(mlir::DialectAsmParser &parser) const {
  llvm_unreachable("custom types not implemented");
}

void OrchestraDialect::printType(mlir::Type type,
                                 mlir::DialectAsmPrinter &printer) const {
  llvm_unreachable("custom types not implemented");
}

mlir::Attribute OrchestraDialect::parseAttribute(mlir::DialectAsmParser &parser,
                                               mlir::Type type) const {
  llvm_unreachable("custom attributes not implemented");
}

void OrchestraDialect::printAttribute(mlir::Attribute attr,
                                      mlir::DialectAsmPrinter &printer) const {
  llvm_unreachable("custom attributes not implemented");
}

// Includes the generated boilerplate definitions for the dialect.
#include "Orchestra/OrchestraDialect.cpp.inc"
```

### 4. Create `include/Orchestra/OrchestraDialect.h`

This is the public header file for your dialect, including the TableGen-generated dialect definition.

```cpp
// In include/Orchestra/OrchestraDialect.h

#ifndef ORCHESTRA_ORCHESTRADISECT_H_
#define ORCHESTRA_ORCHESTRADISECT_H_

#include "mlir/IR/Dialect.h"

// Forward declaration of the dialect namespace.
namespace orchestra {
class OrchestraDialect;
} // namespace orchestra

// This includes the TableGen-generated header file,
// which contains the definition of the OrchestraDialect class.
#include "Orchestra/OrchestraDialect.h.inc"

#endif // ORCHESTRA_ORCHESTRADISECT_H_
```

### 5. Create `lib/Orchestra/CMakeLists.txt`

This CMake file instructs MLIR to process your TableGen files and compile the resulting C++ files, linking against necessary MLIR core libraries.

```cmake
# In lib/Orchestra/CMakeLists.txt

# The name of your dialect library.
set(ORCHESTRA_DIALECT_NAME Orchestra)

# The source files to be compiled (your handwritten C++ files).
set(ORCHESTRA_DIALECT_SRCS
  OrchestraDialect.cpp
)

# Adds the MLIR dialect to the build system.
# This macro handles mlir-tblgen calls and compilation.
add_mlir_dialect(
  ${ORCHESTRA_DIALECT_NAME}
  SRCS ${ORCHESTRA_DIALECT_SRCS}
  TD_FILES OrchestraOps.td # Your TableGen definition file
  # Dependencies on other MLIR dialect libraries that your TD files might reference.
  DEPENDS
    MLIRBuiltin
    MLIRControlFlow
    MLIRSCF
    MLIRArithmetic
    # Add more required MLIR dialects here as your operations become more complex,
    # e.g., MLIRGPU, MLIRMemRef, MLIRLinalg, etc.
)

# Links the generated dialect library against the MLIR Core IR library.
target_link_libraries(${ORCHESTRA_DIALECT_NAME} PUBLIC MLIRIR)
```

### 6. Create `CMakeLists.txt` (Root Directory)

This is the main CMake file for the project. It configures the entire build system and locates your pre-installed MLIR/LLVM libraries.

```cmake
# In orchestra-compiler/CMakeLists.txt

cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.16.0)
project(OrchestraOSCompiler LANGUAGES CXX)

# Find the MLIR and LLVM installation.
# CMake should automatically find packages installed via Homebrew.
find_package(MLIR CONFIG REQUIRED)
find_package(LLVM CONFIG REQUIRED)

# Add your dialect subdirectory to the build.
add_subdirectory(lib/Orchestra)

# Optional: You can create a simple executable here that uses your dialect.
# For this first step, compiling the dialect library is the primary success.
# Later, you might define an `mlir-opt` plugin here.
# add_mlir_tool(
#   orchestra-opt
#   ./tools/OrchestraOptMain.cpp
#   # ... link libraries required by orchestra-opt, e.g., your Orchestra dialect library.
#   LINK_LIBS Orchestra # Links your newly created dialect library
# )
```

### 7. Compile

Navigate to the root directory of your `orchestra-compiler/` project and execute the following commands:

```bash
mkdir build         # Create the build directory
cd build            # Change into the build directory
cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug # Configure the project. Debug mode for easier debugging.
make                # Compile the project
```

## Expected Outcome and "Success"

**If `make` successfully completes, this is your first concrete success.** You will observe `mlir-tblgen` being invoked in the background to generate C++ code from your `.td` file, and this code will then be compiled alongside `OrchestraDialect.cpp`. The output will be a static library (or shared library, depending on CMake configuration) containing your `OrchestraDialect` and the `orchestra.yield` operation.

This step confirms that your local MLIR development environment is correctly set up and that you have a basic understanding of dialect definition and the build process. From this point, you can progressively define more complex operations like `orchestra.task` and `orchestra.commit` and implement their associated C++ logic, with the fundamental compilation process remaining stable.
