# RULES:

1) If unsure about correct syntax: search google. do not guess syntax after failing more than 2 times.

2) You are the first and only developer of this repo. That means feel free to create and delete and refactor anything you like.


# PREREQUISITES:
1) As prerequisites you have to make sure llvm is installed or to install LLVM (and thus `mlir-tblgen`) (e.g., via Homebrew, apt-get or whatever you prefer), providing the necessary MLIR tools. DO NOT GUESS what the latest version of LLVM is, but rather install it the normal way such that the latest stable version is installed.
2) IMPORTANT: all the steps (in the other .md documents), when they talk about linking something to llvm/mlir is maybe not relevant, depending on the way you installed llvm. Your way of handling the llvm is the correct way, if it works.
